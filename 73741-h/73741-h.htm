<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the spring and summer of 1814 the task of diplomacy
was less hopeful than that of arms. Brown and Izard with extreme
difficulty defended the frontier; but Gallatin and Bayard could find
no starting-point for negotiation. Allowed by Castlereagh’s courtesy
to visit England, they crossed the Channel in April, and established
themselves in London. There Gallatin remained until June 21, waiting
for the British government to act, and striving with tact, caution,
and persistency to bring both governments on common ground; but the
attempt was hopeless. England was beside herself with the intoxication
of European success.</p>

<p>Although the English newspapers expressed a false idea of the general
will, and were even at cross purposes with the Ministry in American
matters, their tone was in some respects an indifferent barometer
for measuring the elation or depression of the public temper, and
exercised some influence, rather apparent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span> than real, on the momentary
attitudes of government. Had Castlereagh and his colleagues been really
controlled by the press, no American peace could have been made.
Whatever spirit of friendship for America might exist was necessarily
silent, and only extravagant enmity found expression either in the
press or in society.</p>

<p>Perhaps because ministers were believed to wish for peace with the
United States, the London “Times,” which was not a ministerial
journal, made itself conspicuous in demanding war. The “Times” had not
previously shown a vindictive spirit, but it represented the Wellesley
and Canning interest, which could discover no better course than
that of being more English than England, and more patriotic than the
Government. The “Times” was always ably written and well edited, but
its language toward the United States showed too strong a connection
with that of the Federalists, from whose public and private expressions
the press of England formed its estimate of American character.</p>

<p>The “Times” indulged to excess in the pleasure of its antipathy.
Next to Napoleon, the chief victim of English hatred was Madison.
For so mild a man Madison possessed a remarkable faculty of exciting
invective. The English press surpassed the American Federalists in
their allusions to him, and the “Times” was second to no English
newspaper in the energy of its vituperation. “The lunatic ravings
of the philosophic statesman of Washington” were in its political<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
category of a piece with “his spaniel-like fawning on the Emperor of
Russia.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>... The most abject of the tools of the deposed tyrant; ...
doubtless he expected to be named Prince of the Potomack or Grand
Duke of Virginia.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The “Sun” somewhat less abusively spoke of
“that contemptible wretch Madison, and his gang;”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> but the “Times”
habitually called him liar and impostor.</p>

<p>“Having disposed of all our enemies in Europe,” the “Times” in the
middle of April turned its attention to the United States. “Let us have
no cant of moderation,” was its starting-point. “There is no public
feeling in the country stronger than that of indignation against the
Americans; ... conduct so base, so loathsome, so hateful.... As we
urged the principle, No peace with Bonaparte! so we must maintain
the doctrine of, No peace with James Madison!”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> To this rule the
“Times” steadily adhered with a degree of ill-temper not easily to be
described, and with practical objects freely expressed. “Mr. Madison’s
dirty, swindling manœuvres in respect to Louisiana and the Floridas
remain to be punished,” it declared April 27; and May 17 it pursued the
idea: “He must fall a victim to the just vengeance of the Federalists.
Let us persevere. Let us unmask the impostor.... Who cares about the
impudence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span> which they call a doctrine?... We shall demand indemnity....
We shall insist on security for Canada.... We shall inquire a little
into the American title to Louisiana; and we shall not permit the base
attack on Florida to go unpunished.” May 18 it declared that Madison
had put himself on record as a liar in the cause of his Corsican
master. “He has lived an impostor, and he deserves to meet the fate of
a traitor. That fate now stares him in the face.” May 24 the “Times”
resumed the topic: “They are struck to the heart with terror for their
impending punishment; and oh may no false liberality, no mistaken
lenity, no weak and cowardly policy, interpose to save them from the
blow! Strike! chastise the savages, for such they are!... With Madison
and his perjured set no treaty can be made, for no oath can bind them.”
When British commissioners were at last announced as ready to depart
for Ghent to negotiate for peace with the United States, June 2, the
“Times” gave them instructions: “Our demands may be couched in a single
word,—Submission!”</p>

<p>The “Morning Post,” a newspaper then carrying higher authority than the
“Times,” used language if possible more abusive, and even discovered,
Jan. 18, 1814, “a new trait in the character of the American
government. Enjoying the reputation of being the most unprincipled
and the most contemptible on the face of the earth, they were already
known to be impervious to any noble sentiment; but it is only of late
that we find them insensible of the shame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span> of defeat, destitute even of
the brutish quality of being beaten into a sense of their unworthiness
and their incapacity.” Of Madison the “Morning Post” held the lowest
opinion. He was “a despot in disguise; a miniature imitation” and
miserable tool of Bonaparte, who wrote his Annual Message; a senseless
betrayer of his country.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The “Times” and “Morning Post” were independent newspapers, and spoke
only for themselves; but the “Courier” was supposed to draw inspiration
from the Government, and commonly received the first knowledge of
ministers’ intentions. In temper the “Courier” seemed obliged to vie
with its less favored rivals. The President’s Annual Message of 1813
resembled in its opinion “all the productions of that vain and vulgar
Cabinet;” it was “a compound of canting and hypocrisy, of exaggeration
and falsehood, of coarseness without strength, of assertions without
proof, of the meanest prejudices, and of the most malignant passions;
of undisguised hatred of Great Britain, and of ill-concealed partiality
and servility toward France.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> “We know of no man for whom we feel
greater contempt than for Mr. Madison,” said the “Courier” of May 24.
These illustrations of what the “Courier” called “exaggeration and
falsehood, of coarseness without strength, of assertions without proof,
of the meanest prejudices, and of the most malignant passions” were
probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span> in some degree a form as used by the “Courier,” which would
at a hint from the Ministry adopt a different tone; but announcements
of official acts and intentions were more serious, and claimed more
careful attention.</p>

<p>Immediately after the capitulation of Paris, March 31, the Ministry
turned its attention to the United States, and the “Courier” announced,
April 15, that twenty thousand men were to go from the Garonne to
America. Mr. Madison, the “Courier” added, had “made a pretty kettle of
fish of it.” Twenty thousand men were about two thirds of Wellington’s
English force, and their arrival in America would, as every Englishman
believed, insure the success of the campaign. Not until these troops
were embarked would the Ministry begin to negotiate; but in the middle
of May the military measures were complete, and then the “Courier”
began to prepare the public mind for terms of peace.</p>

<p>These terms were the same as those announced by the “Times,” except
that the “Courier” did not object to treating with Madison. The United
States were to be interdicted the fisheries; Spain was to be supported
in recovering Louisiana; the right of impressment must be expressly
conceded,—anything short of this would be unwise and a disappointment.
“There are points which must be conceded by America before we can put
an end to the contest.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Such language offered no apparent hope of
peace; yet whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span> hope existed lay in Castlereagh, who inspired
it. Extravagant as the demands were, they fell short of the common
expectation. The “Courier” admitted the propriety of negotiation; it
insisted neither on Madison’s retirement nor on a division of the
Union, and it refrained from asserting the whole British demand, or
making it an ultimatum.</p>

<p>The chief pressure on the Ministry came from Canada, and could not
be ignored. The Canadian government returned to its old complaint
that Canadian interests had been ignorantly and wantonly sacrificed
by the treaty of 1783, and that the opportunity to correct the wrong
should not be lost. The Canadian official “Gazette” insisted that the
United States should be required to surrender the northern part of the
State of New York, and that both banks of the St. Lawrence should be
Canadian property.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> A line from Plattsburg to Sackett’s Harbor would
satisfy this necessity; but to secure Canadian interests, the British
government should further insist on acquiring the east bank of the
Niagara River, and on a guaranty of the Indian Territory from Sandusky
to Kaskaskias, with the withdrawal of American military posts in the
Northwest. A pamphlet was published in May to explain the subject
for the use of the British negotiators, and the required territorial
cessions were marked on a map.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The control of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span> the Lakes, the Ohio
River as the Indian boundary, and the restitution of Louisiana were
the chief sacrifices wished from the United States. The cession of a
part of Maine was rather assumed than claimed, and the fisheries were
to be treated as wholly English. A memorial from Newfoundland, dated
Nov. 8, 1813,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> pointed out the advantages which the war had already
brought to British trade and fisheries by the exclusion of American
competition, to the result of doubling the number of men employed on
the Labrador shores; and the memorialists added,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They cannot too often urge the important policy ... of wholly
excluding foreigners from sharing again in the advantages of
a fishery from which a large proportion of our best national
defence will be derived.”</p>
</div>

<p>British confidence was at its highest point when the Emperor of Russia
and the King of Prussia visited London, June 7, and received an
enthusiastic welcome. Gallatin obtained an interview with the Czar,
June 17, and hoped that Russian influence might moderate British
demands; but the Czar could give him no encouragement.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Gallatin
wrote home an often-quoted despatch, dated June 13, warning the
President that fifteen or twenty thousand men were on their way to
America, and that the United States could expect no assistance from
Europe.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have also the most perfect conviction,” Gallatin continued,
“that under the existing unpropitious circumstances of the
world, America cannot by a continuance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span> of the war compel Great
Britain to yield any of the maritime points in dispute, and
particularly to agree to any satisfactory arrangement on the
subject of impressment; and that the most favorable terms of
peace that can be expected are the <i>status ante bellum</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Even these terms, Gallatin added, depended on American success in
withstanding the shock of the campaign. He did not say that at the time
he wrote, the <i>status ante bellum</i> would be scouted by public
opinion in England as favorable to the United States; but his estimate
of the situation was more nearly exact than though he had consulted
only the apparent passions of the British press.</p>

<p>“Lord Castlereagh,” wrote Gallatin to Clay,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> “is, according to the
best information I can collect, the best disposed man in the Cabinet.”
Yet Castlereagh did not venture at that stage to show a disposition for
peace. He delayed the negotiation, perhaps wisely, six weeks after the
American negotiators had assembled at Ghent; and his instructions<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
to the British commissioners, dated July 28, reflected the demands of
the press. They offered, not the <i>status ante bellum</i>, but the
<i>uti possidetis</i>, as the starting-point of negotiation. “The state
of possession must be considered as the territorial arrangement which
would revive upon a peace, except so far as the same may be modified by
any new treaty.” The state of possession, in view of the orders that
had then been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span> given, or were to be given, for the invasion of the
United States, was likely to cost the Americans half of Maine, between
the Penobscot and the Passamaquoddy; Plattsburg, and the northern
part of New York, Vermont, and New Hampshire; Fort Niagara, Mackinaw,
and possibly New Orleans and Mobile. Besides this concession of the
<i>uti possidetis</i>, or military occupation at the date of peace,
the Americans were required at the outset to admit as a <i>sine qua
non</i>, or condition precedent to any negotiation, that England’s
Indian allies, the tribes of the Northwestern Territory, should be
included in the pacification, and that a definite boundary should be
assigned to them under a mutual guaranty of both Powers. Eastport,
or Moose Island, and the fishing privileges were to be regarded as
British. With these instructions of July 28, the British commissioners,
early in August, started for Ghent.</p>

<p>Between Castlereagh’s ideas and those of Madison no relation existed.
Gallatin and his colleagues at Ghent were provided with two sets of
instructions. The first set had been written in 1813, for the expected
negotiation at Petersburg. The second set was written in January, 1814,
and was brought to Europe by Clay. Neither authorized the American
commissioners to discuss such conditions as Castlereagh proposed.
The President gave his negotiators authority to deal with questions
of maritime law; but even there they were allowed to exercise no
discretion on the chief issue in dispute. Monroe’s latest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span> letter,
dated January 28, was emphatic. “On impressment, as to the right of
the United States to be exempted from it, I have nothing to add,” said
the secretary;<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> “the sentiments of the President have undergone no
change on that important subject. This degrading practice must cease;
our flag must protect the crew, or the United States cannot consider
themselves an independent nation.” The President would consent to
exclude all British seamen, except those already naturalized, from
American vessels, and to stipulate the surrender of British deserters;
but the express abandonment of impressment was a <i>sine qua non</i>
of treaty. “If this encroachment of Great Britain is not provided
against,” said Monroe, “the United States have appealed to arms in
vain. If your efforts to accomplish it should fail, all further
negotiations will cease, and you will return home without delay.”</p>

<p>On territorial questions the two governments were equally wide apart.
So far from authorizing a cession of territorial rights, Monroe
instructed the American commissioners, both at St. Petersburg and
at Ghent, “to bring to view the advantage to both countries which
is promised by a transfer of the upper parts and even the whole of
Canada to the United States.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The instructions of January 1<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span> and
January 28, 1814, reiterated the reasoning which should decide England
voluntarily to cede Canada. “Experience has shown that Great Britain
cannot participate in the dominion and navigation of the Lakes without
incurring the danger of an early renewal of the war.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>These instructions were subsequently omitted from the published
documents, probably because the Ghent commissioners decided not to act
upon them;<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> but when the American negotiators met their British
antagonists at Ghent, each party was under orders to exclude the other,
if possible, from the Lakes, and the same divergence of opinion in
regard to the results of two years’ war extended over the whole field
of negotiation. The British were ordered to begin by a <i>sine qua
non</i> in regard to the Indians, which the Americans had no authority
to consider. The Americans were ordered to impose a <i>sine qua
non</i> in regard to impressments, which the British were forbidden to
concede. The British were obliged to claim the basis of possession; the
Americans were not even authorized to admit the status existing before
the war. The Americans were required to negotiate about blockades,
contraband and maritime rights of neutrals; the British could not admit
such subjects into dispute. The British regarded their concessions
of fishing-rights as terminated by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span> the war; the Americans could not
entertain the idea.</p>

<p>The diplomacy that should produce a treaty from such discordant
material must show no ordinary excellence; yet even from that point of
view the prospect was not encouraging. The British government made a
peculiar choice of negotiators. The chief British commissioner, Lord
Gambier, was unknown in diplomacy, or indeed in foreign affairs. A
writer in the London “Morning Chronicle” of August 9 expressed the
general surprise that Government could make no better selection for
the chief of its commission than Lord Gambier, “who was a post-captain
in 1794, and happened to fight the ‘Defence’ decently in Lord Howe’s
action; who slumbered for some time as a Junior Lord of the Admiralty;
who sung psalms, said prayers, and assisted in the burning of
Copenhagen, for which he was made a lord.”</p>

<p>Gambier showed no greater fitness for his difficult task than was to be
expected from his training; and the second member of the commission,
Henry Goulburn, could not supply Gambler’s deficiencies. Goulburn was
Under-Secretary of State to Lord Bathurst; he was a very young man, but
a typical under-secretary, combining some of Francis James Jackson’s
temper with the fixed opinions of the elder Rose, and he had as little
idea of diplomacy as was to be expected from an Under-Secretary of
State for the colonies. The third and last member was William Adams,
Doctor of Civil Law, whose professional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span> knowledge was doubtless
supposed to be valuable to the commission, but who was an unknown man,
and remained one.</p>

<p>Experience had not convinced the British government that in dealing
with the United States it required the best ability it could command.
The mistake made by Lord Shelburne in 1783 was repeated by Lord
Castlereagh in 1814. The miscalculation of relative ability which led
the Foreign Office to assume that Gambier, Goulburn, and William Adams
were competent to deal with Gallatin, J. Q. Adams, J. A. Bayard, Clay,
and Russell was not reasonable. Probably the whole British public
service, including Lords and Commons, could not at that day have
produced four men competent to meet Gallatin, J. Q. Adams, Bayard, and
Clay on the ground of American interests; and when Castlereagh opposed
to them Gambier, Goulburn, and Dr. Adams, he sacrificed whatever
advantage diplomacy offered; for in diplomacy as in generalship, the
individual commanded success.</p>

<p>The only serious difficulty in the American commission was its excess
of strength. By a natural reaction against the attempt to abolish
diplomatic offices, the United States government sent into diplomacy
its most vigorous men. Under favorable conditions, four minds and
wills of so decided a character could not easily work together; but
in the Ghent commission an additional difficulty was created by the
unfortunate interference of the Senate. Originally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span> Gallatin, as
was due to his age, services, and ability, had been the head of the
St. Petersburg commission; but the Senate refused to confirm the
appointment. The President at last removed Gallatin from the Treasury,
and renominated him as a member of the Ghent commission after the
other members had been nominated and confirmed. The Senate then gave
its approval,—thus making Gallatin the last member of the commission
instead of the first, and placing J. Q. Adams above them all.</p>

<p>Gallatin was peculiarly fitted to moderate a discordant body like the
negotiators, while Adams was by temperament little suited to the post
of moderator, and by circumstances ill-qualified to appear as a proper
representative of the commission in the eyes of its other members.
Unless Gallatin were one of the loftiest characters and most loyal
natures ever seen in American politics, Adams’s chance of success in
controlling the board was not within reasonable hope. Gallatin was six
years the senior, and represented the President, with the authority
of close and continuous personal friendship. The board, including
Adams himself, instinctively bowed to Gallatin’s authority; but they
were deferential to no one else, least of all to their nominal head.
Bayard, whose age was the same as that of Adams, was still in name a
Federalist; and although his party trusted him little more than it
trusted Adams or William Pinkney, who had avowedly become Republicans,
he was not the more disposed to follow Adams’s leadership.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span> Clay,
though ten years their junior, was the most difficult of all to
control; and Jonathan Russell, though a New Englander, preferred Clay’s
social charm, and perhaps also his political prospects, to the somewhat
repellent temper and more than doubtful popularity of Adams.</p>

<p>Personal rivalry and jealousies counted for much in such a group; but
these were not the only obstacles to Adams’s influence. By a misfortune
commonly reserved for men of the strongest wills, he represented no
one but himself and a powerless minority. His State repudiated and, in
a manner, ostracized him. Massachusetts gave him no support, even in
defending her own rights; by every means in her power she deprived him
of influence, and loaded him with the burden of her own unpopularity.
Adams represented a community not only hostile to the war, but avowedly
laboring to produce peace by means opposed to those employed at Ghent.
If the Ghent commission should succeed in making a treaty, it could
do so only by some sacrifice of Massachusetts which would ruin Adams
at home. If the Ghent commission should fail, Adams must be equally
ruined by any peace produced through the treasonable intrigues or overt
rebellion of his State.</p>

<p>Such a head to a commission so constituted needed all the force of
character which Adams had, and some qualities he did not possess, in
order to retain enough influence to shape any project into a treaty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
that he could consent to sign; while Gallatin’s singular tact and
nobility of character were never more likely to fail than in the effort
to make allowance for the difficulties of his chief’s position. Had
Castlereagh improved the opportunity by sending to Ghent one competent
diplomatist, or even a well-informed and intelligent man of business,
like Alexander Baring, he might probably have succeeded in isolating
Adams, and in negotiating with the other four commissioners a treaty
sacrificing Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The five American commissioners were ready to negotiate in June; but
Castlereagh, for obvious reasons, wished delay, and deferred action
until August, doubtless intending to prevent the signature of a treaty
on the basis of <i>uti possidetis</i> until after September, when
Sherbrooke and Prevost should have occupied the territory intended to
be held. In May and June no one in England, unless it were Cobbett,
entertained more than a passing doubt of British success on land and
water; least of all did the three British commissioners expect to yield
British demands. They came to impose terms, or to break negotiation.
They were not sent to yield any point in dispute, or to seek a
cessation of arms.</p>

<p>At one o’clock on the afternoon of August 8, the first conference took
place in the Hotel des Pays Bas at Ghent. After the usual civilities
and forms had passed, Goulburn took the lead, and presented the
points which he and his colleagues were authorized to discuss,—(1)
Impressment and allegiance; (2)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span> the Indians and their boundary, a
<i>sine qua non</i>; (3) the Canadian boundary; (4) the privilege of
landing and drying fish within British jurisdiction. Goulburn declared
that it was not intended to contest the right of the United States to
the fisheries, by which he probably meant the deep-sea fisheries; and
he was understood to disavow the intention of acquiring territory by
the revision of the Canada boundary; but he urged an immediate answer
upon the question whether the Americans were instructed on the point
made a <i>sine qua non</i> by the British government.</p>

<p>The Americans, seeing as yet only a small part of the British demands,
were not so much surprised at Goulburn’s points as unable to answer
them. The next day they replied in conference that they had no
authority to admit either Indian boundary or fisheries into question,
being without instructions on these points; and in their turn presented
subjects of discussion,—Blockades and Indemnities; but professed
themselves willing to discuss everything.</p>

<p>In the conversation following this reply, the British commissioners,
with some apparent unwillingness, avowed the intention of erecting the
Indian Territory into a barrier between the British possessions and the
United States; and the American commissioners declined even to retire
for consultation on the possibility of agreeing to such an article. The
British commissioners then proposed to suspend conferences until they
could receive further instructions, and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span> wish was followed. Both
parties sent despatches to their Governments.</p>

<p>Lord Castlereagh was prompt. As soon as was reasonably possible he sent
more precise instructions. Dated August 14,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> these supplementary
instructions gave to those of July 28 a distinct outline. They proposed
the Indian boundary fixed by the Treaty of Greenville for the permanent
barrier between British and American dominion, beyond which neither
government should acquire land. They claimed also a “rectification” of
the Canadian frontier, and the cession of Fort Niagara and Sackett’s
Harbor, besides a permanent prohibition on the United States from
keeping either naval forces or land fortifications on the Lakes. Beyond
these demands the British commissioners were not for the present to go,
nor were they to ask for a direct cession of territory for Canada “with
any view to an acquisition of territory as such, but for the purpose
of securing her possessions and preventing future disputes;”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> yet a
small cession of land in Maine was necessary for a road from Halifax to
Quebec, and an arrangement of the Northwestern boundary was required to
coincide with the free navigation of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>As soon as the new instructions reached Ghent the British commissioners
summoned the Americans to another conference, August 19; and Goulburn,
reading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span> from Castlereagh’s despatch, gave to the Americans a clear
version of its contents.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> When he had finished, Gallatin asked
what was to be done with the American citizens—perhaps one hundred
thousand in number—already settled beyond the Greenville line, in
Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Michigan? Goulburn and Dr. Adams replied
that these people must shift for themselves. They added also that
Moose Island and Eastport belonged to Great Britain as indisputably
as the county of Northamptonshire, and were not a subject for
discussion; but they would not then make a <i>sine qua non</i> of the
proposition regarding the Lakes. The conference ended, leaving the
Americans convinced that their answer to these demands would close the
negotiation. Clay alone, whose knowledge of the Western game of brag
stood him in good stead, insisted that the British would recede.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The British commissioners the next day, August 20, sent an official
note containing their demands, and the Americans before sending their
reply forwarded the note to America, with despatches dated August
19 and 20, announcing that they intended to return “a unanimous and
decided negative.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> They then undertook the task of drawing up their
reply. Upon Adams as head of the commission fell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span> the duty of drafting
formal papers,—a duty which, without common consent, no other member
could assume. His draft met with little mercy, and the five gentlemen
sat until eleven o’clock of August 24, “sifting, erasing, patching, and
amending until we were all wearied, though none of us was yet satiated
with amendment.” At the moment when they gave final shape to the note
which they believed would render peace impossible, the army of General
Ross was setting fire to the Capitol at Washington, and President
Madison was seeking safety in the Virginia woods.</p>

<p>Only to persons acquainted with the difficulties of its composition did
the American note of August 24 show signs of its diverse origin.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> In
dignified temper, with reasoning creditable to its authors and decisive
on its issues, it assured the British negotiators that any such
arrangement as they required for the Indians was contrary to precedent
in public law, was not founded on reciprocity, and was unnecessary for
its professed object in regard to the Indians. The other demands were
equally inadmissible:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They are founded neither on reciprocity, nor on any of
the usual bases of negotiation, neither on that of <i>uti
possidetis</i> nor of <i>status ante bellum</i>. They are above
all dishonorable to the United States in demanding from them to
abandon territory and a portion of their citizens; to admit a
foreign interference in their domestic concerns, and to cease to
exercise their natural rights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span> on their own shores and in their
own waters. A treaty concluded on such terms would be but an
armistice.”</p>
</div>

<p>The negotiators were ready to terminate the war, both parties restoring
whatever territory might have been taken, and reserving their rights
over their respective seamen; but such demands as were made by the
British government could not be admitted even for reference.</p>

<p>The American reply was sent to the British commissioners August 25,
“and will bring the negotiation,” remarked J. Q. Adams, “very shortly
to a close.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The American commissioners prepared to quit Ghent
and return to their several posts, while the British commissioners
waited for instructions from London. Even Gallatin, who had clung to
the hope that he could effect an arrangement, abandoned the idea, and
believing that the British government had adopted a system of conquest,
prepared for an immediate return to America.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Goulburn also notified
his Government that the negotiation was not likely to continue, and
reported some confidential warnings from Bayard that such conditions
of peace would not only insure war, but would sacrifice the Federalist
party. “It has not made the least impression upon me or upon my
colleagues,” reported Goulburn to Bathurst.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span></p>

<p>At that point the negotiation remained stationary for two months,
kept alive by Liverpool, Castlereagh, and Bathurst, while they waited
for the result of their American campaign. The despatch of August 20
crossed the Atlantic, and was communicated to Congress October 10,
together with all other papers connected with the negotiation; but not
until October 25 did the American commissioners write again to their
Government.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> British note of August 19 and the American rejoinder of
August 24, brought about a situation where Lord Castlereagh’s influence
could make itself felt. Castlereagh had signed the British instructions
of July 28 and August 14,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and himself brought the latter to Ghent,
where he passed August 19, before going to Paris on his way to the
Congress at Vienna. He was at Ghent when Goulburn and his colleagues
held their conference and wrote their note of August 19;<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and he
could not be supposed ignorant of their language or acts. Yet when he
received at Paris letters from Goulburn, dated August 24 and 26,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> he
expressed annoyance that the American commissioners should have been
allowed to place England in the attitude of continuing the war for
purposes of conquest, and still more that the British commissioners
should be willing to accept that issue and break off negotiation upon
it. In a letter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span> to Lord Bathurst, who took charge of the negotiation
in his absence, Castlereagh suggested ideas altogether different from
those till then advanced in England.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The substance of the question is,” said Castlereagh, “Are we
prepared to continue the war for territorial arrangements?
And if not, is this the best time to make our peace, saving
all our rights, and claiming the fisheries, which they do not
appear to question? In which case the territorial questions
might be reserved for ulterior discussion. Or is it desirable
to take the chance of the campaign, and then to be governed by
circumstances?... If we thought an immediate peace desirable,
as they are ready to waive all the abstract questions, perhaps
they might be prepared to sign a provisional article of Indian
peace as distinct from limits, and relinquish their pretensions
to the islands in Passamaquoddy Bay, and possibly to admit minor
adjustments of frontier, including a right of communication from
Quebec to Halifax across their territory. But while I state
this, I feel the difficulty of so much letting down the question
under present circumstances.”</p>
</div>

<p>At the same time Castlereagh wrote to Goulburn, directing him to wait
at Ghent for new instructions from London.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Lord Liverpool shared
his disapproval of the manner in which the British commissioners had
managed the case, and replied to Castlereagh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span> September 2, that the
Cabinet had already acted in the sense he wished:<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Our commissioners had certainly taken a very erroneous view of
our policy. If the negotiation had been allowed to break off
upon the two notes already presented, or upon such an answer as
they were disposed to return, I am satisfied that the war would
have become quite popular in America.”</p>
</div>

<p>The idea that the war might become popular in America was founded
chiefly on the impossibility of an Englishman’s conceiving the
contrary; but in truth the Ministry most feared that the war might
become unpopular in England.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is very material to throw the rupture of the negotiation, if
it is to take place, upon the Americans,” wrote Liverpool, the
same day, to the Duke of Wellington;<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> “and not to allow them
to say that we have brought forward points as ultimata which
were only brought forward for discussion, and at the desire of
the American commissioners themselves. The American note is a
most impudent one, and, as to all its reasoning, capable of an
irresistible answer.”</p>
</div>

<p>New instructions were accordingly approved in Cabinet.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Drawn
by Bathurst, and dated September 1, they contained what Liverpool
considered an “irresistible answer” to the American note of August
24;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span> but their force of logic was weakened by the admission that the
previous British demands, though certainly stated as a <i>sine qua
non</i>, were in reality not to be regarded as such. In private this
retreat was covered by the pretext that it was intended only to keep
the negotiation alive until better terms could be exacted.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We cannot expect that the negotiation will proceed at present,”
continued Liverpool’s letter to Castlereagh; “but I think it
not unlikely, after our note has been delivered in, that the
American commissioners will propose to refer the subject to
their Government. In that case the negotiation may be adjourned
till the answer is received, and we shall know the result of
the campaign before it can be resumed. If our commander does
his duty, I am persuaded we shall have acquired by our arms
every point on the Canadian frontier which we ought to insist on
keeping.”</p>
</div>

<p>Lord Gambier and his colleagues communicated their new instructions
to the American negotiators in a long note dated September 4, and
were answered by a still longer note dated September 9, which was
also sent to London, and considered in Cabinet. Bathurst felt no
anxiety about the negotiation in its actual stage. Goulburn wrote to
him that “as long as we answer their notes, I believe that they will
be ready to give us replies,” and urged only that Sir George Prevost
should hasten his reluctant movements in Canada.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span> Bathurst wrote
more instructions, dated September 16, directing his commissioners
to abandon the demands for Indian territory and exclusive control of
the Lakes, and to ask only that the Indians should be included in
the peace.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The British commissioners sent their note with these
concessions to the Americans September 19; and then for the first time
the Americans began to suspect the possibility of serious negotiation.
For six weeks they had dealt only with the question whether they should
negotiate at all.</p>

<p>The demand that the Indians should be included in the treaty was one
that under favorable circumstances the Americans would have rejected;
but none of them seriously thought of rejecting it as their affairs
then stood. When the American commissioners discussed the subject among
themselves, September 20, Adams proposed to break off the negotiation
on that issue; but Gallatin good-naturedly overruled him, and Adams
would not himself, on cool reflection, have ventured to take such
responsibility. Indeed, he suggested an article for an Indian amnesty,
practically accepting the British demand.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> He also yielded to
Gallatin the ungrateful task of drafting the answers to the British
notes; and thus Gallatin became in effect the head of the commission.</p>

<p>All Gallatin’s abilities were needed to fill the place. In his entire
public life he had never been required to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span> manage so unruly a set of
men. The British commissioners were trying, and especially Goulburn was
aggressive in temper and domineering in tone; but with them Gallatin
had little trouble. Adams and Clay were persons of a different type, as
far removed from British heaviness as they were from the Virginian ease
of temper which marked the Cabinet of Jefferson, or the incompetence
which characterized that of Madison. Gallatin was obliged to exert all
his faculties to control his colleagues; but whenever he succeeded,
he enjoyed the satisfaction of feeling that he had colleagues worth
controlling. They were bent on combat, if not with the British, at
all events with each other; and Gallatin was partly amused and partly
annoyed by the unnecessary energy of their attitude.</p>

<p>The first divergence occurred in framing the reply to the British note
of September 19, which while yielding essentials made a series of
complaints against the United States,—and among the rest reproached
them for their attempt to conquer Canada, and their actual seizure
of Florida. Adams, who knew little about the secrets of Jefferson’s
and Madison’s Administrations, insisted on resenting the British
charges, and especially on justifying the United States government in
its attacks upon Florida. Bayard protested that he could not support
such a view, because he had himself publicly in Congress denounced the
Government on the subject of Florida; and Gallatin was almost equally
committed, for, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span> frankly said, he had opposed in Cabinet for
a whole year what had been done in Florida before he could succeed
in stopping it.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Clay said nothing, but he had strong reasons for
wishing that the British negotiators should not be challenged to quote
his notorious speeches on the conquest of Canada. Adams produced
Monroe’s instructions, and in the end compelled his colleagues to
yield. His mistake in pressing such an issue was obvious to every
one but himself, and would have been evident to him had he not been
blinded by irritation at the British note. His colleagues retaliated by
summarily rejecting as cant his argument that moral and religious duty
required the Americans to take and settle the land of the Indians.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>After much discussion their note was completed and sent, September 26,
to the British commissioners,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> who forwarded it as usual to London,
with a letter from Goulburn of the same date, written in the worst
possible temper, and charging the American commissioners with making
a variety of false and fraudulent statements.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> While the British
Cabinet detained it longer than usual for consideration, the Americans
at Ghent felt their position grow weaker day by day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span></p>

<p>Nothing warranted a serious hope of peace. Goulburn and his colleagues
showed no thought of yielding acceptable conditions. The London
“Courier” of September 29 announced what might be taken for a
semi-official expression of the Ministry:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Peace they [the Americans] may make, but it must be on
condition that America has not a foot of land on the waters of
the St. Lawrence, ... no settlement on the Lakes, ... no renewal
of the treaties of 1783 and 1794; ... and they must explicitly
abandon their newfangled principles of the law of nations.”</p>
</div>

<p>Liverpool, writing to Castlereagh September 23,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> said that in his
opinion the Cabinet had “now gone to the utmost justifiable point in
concession, and if they [the Americans] are so unreasonable as to
reject our proposals, we have nothing to do but to fight it out. The
military accounts from America are on the whole satisfactory.” The news
of the cruel humiliation at Bladensburg and the burning of Washington
arrived at Ghent October 1, and caused British and Americans alike to
expect a long series of British triumphs, especially on Lake Champlain,
where they knew the British force to be overwhelming.</p>

<p>Goulburn exerted himself to produce a rupture. His letter of September
26 to Bathurst treated the American offer of an Indian amnesty as
a rejection of the British ultimatum. Again Lord Bathurst set him
right by sending him, October 5, the draft of a reciprocal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span> article
replacing the Indians in their situation before the war; and the
British commissioners in a note dated October 8, 1814, communicated
this article once more as an ultimatum.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Harrison’s treaty of July
22 with the Wyandots, Delawares, Shawanees, and other tribes, binding
them to take up arms against the British, had then arrived, and this
news lessened the interest of both parties in the Indian question. None
of the American negotiators were prepared to break off negotiations on
that point at such a time, and Clay was so earnest to settle the matter
that he took from Gallatin and Adams the task of writing the necessary
acceptance of the British ultimatum. Gallatin and Clay decided to
receive the British article as according entirely with the American
offer of amnesty, and the note was so written.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>With this cordial admission of the British ultimatum the Americans
coupled an intimation that the time had come when an exchange of
general projects for the proposed treaty should be made. More than two
months of discussion had then resulted only in eliminating the Indians
from the dispute, and in agreeing to maintain silence in regard to
the Lakes. Another great difficulty which had been insuperable was
voluntarily removed by President Madison and his Cabinet, who after
long and obstinate resistance at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span> last authorized the commissioners,
by instructions dated June 27, to omit impressment from the treaty.
Considering the frequent positive declarations of the United States
government, besides the rejection of Monroe’s treaty in 1807 and of
Admiral Warren’s and Sir George Prevost’s armistice of 1812 for want
of an explicit concession on that point, Monroe’s letter of June 27
was only to be excused as an act of common-sense or of necessity.
The President preferred to represent it as an act of common-sense,
warranted by the peace in Europe, which promised to offer no further
occasion for the claim or the denial of the British right. On the same
principle the subject of blockades was withdrawn from discussion; and
these concessions, balanced by the British withdrawal from the Indian
ultimatum and the Lake armaments, relieved the American commissioners
of all their insuperable difficulties.</p>

<p>The British commissioners were not so easily rescued from their
untenable positions. The American note of October 13, sent as usual to
London, was answered by Bathurst October 18 and 20,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> in instructions
revealing the true British terms more completely than had yet been
ventured. Bathurst at length came to the cardinal point of the
negotiation. As the American commissioners had said in their note of
August 24, the British government must choose between the two ordinary
bases of treaties of peace,—the state before the war, or <i>status<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
ante bellum</i>; and the state of possession, or <i>uti possidetis</i>.
Until the middle of October, 1814, the <i>uti possidetis</i>, as
a basis of negotiation, included whatever country might have been
occupied by Sir George Prevost in his September campaign. Bathurst
from the first intended to insist on the state of possession, but had
not thought proper to avow it. His instructions of October 18 and 20
directed the British commissioners to come to the point, and to claim
the basis of <i>uti possidetis</i> from the American negotiators:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On their admitting this to be the basis on which they are
ready to negotiate, but not before they have admitted it, you
will proceed to state the mutual accommodations which may be
entered into in conformity with this basis. The British occupy
Fort Michillimackinaw, Fort Niagara, and all the country east
of the Penobscot. On the other hand the forces of the United
States occupy Fort Erie and Fort Amherstburg [Malden]. On the
government of the United States consenting to restore these two
forts, Great Britain is ready to restore the forts of Castine
and Machias, retaining Fort Niagara and Fort Michillimackinaw.”</p>
</div>

<p>Thus the British demand, which had till then been intended to include
half of Maine and the whole south bank of the St. Lawrence River from
Plattsburg to Sackett’s Harbor, suddenly fell to a demand for Moose
Island, a right of way across the northern angle of Maine, Fort Niagara
with five miles circuit, and the Island of Mackinaw. The reason for
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span> new spirit of moderation was not far to seek. On the afternoon of
October 17, while the British Cabinet was still deliberating on the
basis of <i>uti possidetis</i>, news reached London that the British
invasion of northern New York, from which so much had been expected,
had totally failed, and that Prevost’s large army had precipitately
retreated into Canada. The London “Times” of October 19 was frank in
its expressions of disappointment:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This is a lamentable event to the civilized world.... The
subversion of that system of fraud and malignity which
constitutes the whole policy of the Jeffersonian school ... was
an event to which we should have bent and yet must bend all our
energies. The present American government must be displaced, or
it will sooner or later plant its poisoned dagger in the heart
of the parent State.”</p>
</div>

<p>The failure of the attempt on Baltimore and Drummond’s bloody repulse
at Fort Erie became known at the same time, and coming together at a
critical moment threw confusion into the Ministry and their agents in
the press and the diplomatic service throughout Europe. The “Courier”
of October 25 declared that “peace with America is neither practicable
nor desirable till we have wiped away this late disaster;” but the
“Morning Chronicle” of October 21–24 openly intimated that the game of
war was at an end. October 31, the Paris correspondent of the London
“Times” told of the cheers that rose from the crowds in the Palais
Royal gardens at each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span> recital of the Plattsburg defeat; and October 21
Goulburn wrote from Ghent to Bathurst,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The news from America is very far from satisfactory. Even our
brilliant success at Baltimore, as it did not terminate in the
capture of the town, will be considered by the Americans as a
victory and not as an escape.... If it were not for the want of
fuel in Boston, I should be quite in despair.”</p>
</div>

<p>In truth the blockade was the single advantage held by England; and
even in that advantage the Americans had a share as long as their
cruisers surrounded the British Islands.</p>

<p>Liverpool wrote to Castlereagh, October 21,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> commenting severely on
Prevost’s failure, and finding consolation only in the thought that the
Americans showed themselves even less patriotic than he had supposed
them to be:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The capture and destruction of Washington has not united the
Americans: quite the contrary. We have gained more credit
with them by saving private property than we have lost by the
destruction of their public works and buildings. Madison clings
to office, and I am strongly inclined to think that the best
thing for us is that he should remain there.”</p>
</div>

<p>Castlereagh at Vienna found himself unable to make the full influence
of England felt, so long as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span> such mortifying disasters by land and sea
proved her inability to deal with an enemy she persisted in calling
contemptible.</p>

<p>On the American commissioners the news came, October 21, with the
effect of a reprieve from execution. Gallatin was deeply moved; Adams
could not believe the magnitude of the success; but as far as regarded
their joint action, the overthrow of England’s scheme produced no
change. Their tone had always been high, and they saw no advantage
to be gained by altering it. The British commissioners sent to them,
October 21, the substance of the new instructions, offering the
basis of <i>uti possidetis</i>, subject to modifications for mutual
convenience.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The Americans by common consent, October 23, declined
to treat on that basis, or on any other than the mutual restoration
of territory.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> They thought that the British government was still
playing with them, when in truth Lord Bathurst had yielded the chief
part of the original British demand, and had come to what the whole
British empire regarded as essentials,—the right of way to Quebec, and
the exclusion of American fishermen from British shores and waters.</p>

<p>The American note of October 24, bluntly rejecting the basis of <i>uti
possidetis</i>, created a feeling akin to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span> consternation in the British
Cabinet. At first, ministers assumed that the war must go on, and
deliberated only on the point to be preferred for a rupture. “We still
think it desirable to gain a little more time before the negotiation
is brought to a close,” wrote Liverpool to the Duke of Wellington,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
October 28; and on the same day he wrote to Castlereagh at Vienna to
warn him that the American war “will probably now be of some duration,”
and treating of its embarrassments without disguise.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The Czar’s
conduct at Vienna had annoyed and alarmed all the great Powers, and
the American war gave him a decisive advantage over England; but even
without the Russian complication, the prospect for ministers was not
cheering.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Looking to a continuance of the American war, our financial
state is far from satisfactory,” wrote Lord Liverpool; “... the
American war will not cost us less than £10,000,000, in addition
to our peace establishment and other expenses. We must expect,
therefore, to hear it said that the property tax is continued
for the purpose of securing a better frontier for Canada.”</p>
</div>

<p>A week passed without bringing encouragement to the British Cabinet.
On the contrary the Ministry learned that a vigorous prosecution of
hostilities would cost much more than ten million pounds, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span> when
Liverpool next wrote to Castlereagh, November 2,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> although he could
still see “little prospect for our negotiations at Ghent ending in
peace,” he added that “the continuance of the American war will entail
upon us a prodigious expense, much more than we had any idea of.” A
Cabinet meeting was to be held the next day, November 3, to review the
whole course of policy as to America.</p>

<p>Throughout the American difficulties, from first to last, the most
striking quality shown by the British government was the want of
intelligence which caused the war, and marked the conduct of both
the war and the negotiations. If the foreign relations of every
government were marked by the same character, politics could be no
more than rivalry in the race to blunder; but in October, 1814,
another quality almost equally striking became evident. The weakness
of British councils was as remarkable as their want of intelligence.
The government of England had exasperated the Americans to an animosity
that could not forget or forgive, and every dictate of self-interest
required that it should carry out its policy to the end. Even domestic
politics in Parliament might have been more easily managed by drawing
public criticism to America, while in no event could taxes be reduced
to satisfy the public demand.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Another year<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span> of war was the
consistent and natural course for ministers to prefer.</p>

<p>So the Cabinet evidently thought; but instead of making a decision,
the Cabinet council of November 3 resorted to the expedient of
shifting responsibility upon the Duke of Wellington. The Duke was then
Ambassador at Paris. His life had been threatened by angry officers of
Napoleon, who could not forgive his victories at Vittoria and Toulouse.
For his own security he might be sent to Canada, and if he went, he
should go with full powers to close the war as he pleased.</p>

<p>The next day, November 4, Liverpool wrote to Wellington, explaining
the wishes of the Cabinet, and inviting him to take the entire command
in Canada, in order to bring the war to an honorable conclusion.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
Wellington replied November 9,—and his words were the more interesting
because, after inviting and receiving so decided an opinion from
so high an authority, the Government could not easily reject it.
Wellington began by reviewing the military situation, and closed by
expressing his opinion on the diplomatic contest:<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have already told you and Lord Bathurst that I feel no
objection to going to America, though I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span> promise to myself
much success there. I believe there are troops enough there for
the defence of Canada forever, and even for the accomplishment
of any reasonable offensive plan that could be formed from the
Canadian frontier. I am quite sure that all the American armies
of which I have ever read would not beat out of a field of
battle the troops that went from Bordeaux last summer, if common
precautions and care were taken of them. That which appears
to me to be wanting in America is not a general, or a general
officer and troops, but a naval superiority on the Lakes.”</p>
</div>

<p>These views did not altogether accord with those of Americans, who
could not see that the British generals made use of the Lakes even
when controlling them, but who saw the troops of Wellington retire
from one field of battle after another,—at Plattsburg, Baltimore, and
New Orleans,—while taking more than common precautions. Wellington’s
military comments showed little interest in American affairs, and
evidently he saw nothing to be gained by going to Canada. His
diplomatic ideas betrayed the same bias:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In regard to your present negotiations, I confess that I think
you have no right, from the state of the war, to demand any
concession of territory from America.... You have not been able
to carry it into the enemy’s territory, notwithstanding your
military success and now undoubted military superiority, and
have not even cleared your own territory on the point of attack.
You cannot on any principle of equality in negotiation claim a
cession of territory excepting in exchange for other advantages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
which you have in your power.... Then if this reasoning be
true, why stipulate for the <i>uti possidetis</i>? You can get
no territory; indeed, the state of your military operations,
however creditable, does not entitle you to demand any.”</p>
</div>

<p>After such an opinion from the first military authority of England, the
British Ministry had no choice but to abandon its claim for territory.
Wellington’s letter reached London about November 13, and was duly
considered in the Cabinet. Liverpool wrote to Castlereagh, November 18,
that the Ministry had made its decision; the claim for territory was
to be abandoned. For this retreat he alleged various excuses,—such
as the unsatisfactory state of the negotiations at Vienna, and the
alarming condition of France; the finances, the depression of rents,
and the temper of Parliament.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Such reasoning would have counted for
nothing in the previous month of May, but six months wrought a change
in public feeling. The war had lost public favor. Even the colonial and
shipping interests and the navy were weary of it, while the army had
little to expect from it but hard service and no increase of credit.
Every Englishman who came in contact with Americans seemed to suffer.
Broke, the only victor by sea, was a lifelong invalid; and Brock and
Ross, the only victors on land, had paid for their success with their
lives. Incessant disappointment made the war an unpleasant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span> thought
with Englishmen. The burning of Washington was an exploit of which
they could not boast. The rate of marine insurance was a daily and
intolerable annoyance. So rapidly did the war decline in favor, that in
the first half of December it was declared to be decidedly unpopular by
one of the most judicious English liberals, Francis Horner; although
Horner held that the Americans, as the dispute then stood, were the
aggressors.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The tone of the press showed the same popular tendency,
for while the “Times” grumbled loudly over the Canada campaign, the
“Morning Chronicle” no longer concealed its hostility to the war, and
ventured to sneer at it, talking of “the entire defeat and destruction
of the last British fleet but one; for it has become necessary to
particularize them now.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>While the Cabinet still waited, the first instalment of Ghent
correspondence to August 20, published in America October 10, returned
to England November 18, and received no flattering attention. “We
cannot compliment our negotiators,” remarked the “Morning Chronicle;”
and the “Times” was still less pleased. “The British government has
been tricked into bringing forward demands which it had not the power
to enforce.... Why treat at all with Mr. Madison?” In Parliament,
November 19, the liberal opposition attacked the Government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span> for
setting up novel pretensions. Ministers needed no more urging, and
Bathurst thenceforward could not be charged with waste of time.</p>

<p>During this interval of more than three weeks the negotiators at
Ghent were left to follow their own devices. In order to provide the
Americans with occupation, the British commissioners sent them a note
dated October 31 calling for a counter-project, since the basis of
<i>uti possidetis</i> was refused.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> This note, with all the others
since August 20, was sent by the Americans to Washington on the same
day, October 31; and then Gallatin and Adams began the task of drafting
the formal project of a treaty. Immediately the internal discords of
the commission broke into earnest dispute. A struggle began between the
East and the West over the fisheries and the Mississippi.</p>

<p>The treaty of 1783 coupled the American right of fishing in British
waters and curing fish on British shores with the British right of
navigating the Mississippi River. For that arrangement the elder Adams
was responsible. The fisheries were a Massachusetts interest. At Paris
in 1783 John Adams, in season and out of season, with his colleagues
and with the British negotiators, insisted, with the intensity of
conviction, that the fishing rights which the New England people held
while subjects of the British crown were theirs by no grant or treaty,
but as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span> a natural right, which could not be extinguished by war; and
that where British subjects had a right to fish, whether on coasts or
shores, in bays, inlets, creeks, or harbors, Americans had the same
right, to be exercised wherever and whenever they pleased. John Adams’s
persistence secured the article of the definitive treaty, which,
without expressly admitting a natural right, coupled the in-shore
fisheries and the navigation of the Mississippi with the recognition
of independence. In 1814 as in 1783 John Adams clung to his trophies,
and his son would have waged indefinite war rather than break his
father’s heart by sacrificing what he had won; but at Ghent the son
stood in isolation which the father in the worst times had never known.
Massachusetts left him to struggle alone for a principle that needed
not only argument but force to make it victorious. Governor Strong did
not even write to him as he did to Pickering, that Massachusetts would
give an equivalent in territory for the fisheries. As far as the State
could influence the result, the fisheries were to be lost by default.</p>

<p>Had Adams encountered only British opposition he might have overborne
it as his father had done; but since 1783 the West had become a
political power, and Louisiana had been brought into the Union. If the
fisheries were recognized as an indefeasible right by the treaty of
1783, the British liberty of navigating the Mississippi was another
indefeasible right, which must revive with peace. The Western people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
naturally objected to such a proposition. Neither they nor the
Canadians could be blamed for unwillingness to impose a mischievous
servitude forever upon their shores, and Clay believed his popularity
to depend on preventing an express recognition of the British right
to navigate the Mississippi. Either Clay or Adams was sure to refuse
signing any treaty which expressly sacrificed the local interests of
either.</p>

<p>In this delicate situation only the authority and skill of Gallatin
saved the treaty. At the outset of the discussion, October 30, Gallatin
quietly took the lead from Adams’s hands, and assumed the championship
of the fisheries by proposing to renew both privileges, making the one
an equivalent for the other. Clay resisted obstinately, while Gallatin
gently and patiently overbore him. When Gallatin’s proposal was put
to the vote November 5, Clay and Russell alone opposed it,—and the
support then given by Russell to Clay was never forgotten by Adams.
Clay still refusing to sign the offer, Gallatin continued his pressure,
until at last, November 10, Clay consented to insert, not in the
project of treaty, but in the note which accompanied it, a paragraph
declaring that the commissioners were not authorized to bring into
discussion any of the rights hitherto enjoyed in the fisheries; “From
their nature, and from the peculiar character of the treaty of 1783
by which they were recognized, no further stipulation has been deemed
necessary by the Government of the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span> States to entitle them to
the full enjoyment of all of them.”</p>

<p>Clay signed the note,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> though unwillingly; and it was sent,
November 10, with the treaty project, to the British commissioners,
who forwarded it to London, where it arrived at the time when the
British Cabinet had at last decided on peace. Bathurst sent his reply
in due course; and Goulburn’s disgust was great to find that instead of
breaking negotiation on the point of the fisheries as he wished,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
he was required once more to give way. “You know that I was never much
inclined to give way to the Americans,” he wrote, November 25.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> “I
am still less inclined to do so after the statement of our demands with
which the negotiation opened, and which has in every point of view
proved most unfortunate.”</p>

<p>The British reply, dated November 26,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> took no notice of the
American reservation as to the fisheries, but inserted in the project
the old right of navigating the Mississippi. Both Bathurst and Goulburn
thought that their silence, after the American declaration, practically
conceded the American right to the fisheries, though Gambier and Dr.
Adams thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span> differently.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> In either case the British note of
November 26, though satisfactory to Adams, was far from agreeable
to Clay, who was obliged to endanger the peace in order to save the
Mississippi. Adams strongly inclined to take the British project
precisely as it was offered,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> but Gallatin overruled him, and Clay
would certainly have refused to sign. In discussing the subject,
November 28, Gallatin proposed to accept the article on the navigation
of the Mississippi if the British would add a provision recognizing the
fishing rights. Clay lost his temper, and intimated something more than
willingness to let Massachusetts pay for the pleasure of peace;<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
but during the whole day of November 28, and with the same patience
November 29, Gallatin continued urging Clay and restraining Adams,
until at last on the third day he brought the matter to the point he
wished.</p>

<p>The result of this long struggle saved not indeed the fisheries, but
the peace. Clay made no further protest when, in conference with the
British commissioners December 1, the Americans offered to renew both
the disputed rights.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Their proposal was sent to London, and was
answered by Bathurst December 6, in a letter offering to set aside
for future negotiation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span> the terms under which the old fishing liberty
and the navigation of the Mississippi should be continued for fair
equivalents.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> The British commissioners communicated this suggestion
in conference December 10, and threw new dissension among the Americans.</p>

<p>The British offer to reserve both disputed rights for future
negotiation implied that both rights were forfeited, or subject to
forfeit, by war,—an admission which Adams could not make, but which
the other commissioners could not reject. At that point Adams found
himself alone. Even Gallatin admitted that the claim to the natural
right of catching and curing fish on British shores was untenable, and
could never be supported. Adams’s difficulties were the greater because
the question of peace and war was reduced to two points,—the fisheries
and Moose Island,—both interesting to Massachusetts alone. Yet the
Americans were unwilling to yield without another struggle, and decided
still to resist the British claim as inconsistent with the admitted
basis of the <i>status ante bellum</i>.</p>

<p>The struggle with the British commissioners then became warm. A long
conference, December 12, brought no conclusion. The treaty of 1783
could neither be followed nor ignored, and perplexed the Englishmen
as much as the Americans. During December 13 and December 14, Adams
continued to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span> press his colleagues to assert the natural right to the
fisheries, and to insist on the permanent character of the treaty of
1783; but Gallatin would not consent to make that point an ultimatum.
All the commissioners except Adams resigned themselves to the sacrifice
of the fisheries; but Gallatin decided to make one more effort before
abandoning the struggle, and with that object drew up a note rejecting
the British stipulation because it implied the abandonment of a right,
but offering either to be silent as to both the fisheries and the
Mississippi, or to admit a general reference to further negotiation of
all subjects in dispute, so expressed as to imply no abandonment of
right.</p>

<p>The note was signed and sent December 14,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and the Americans waited
another week for the answer. Successful as they had been in driving
their British antagonists from one position after another, they were
not satisfied. Adams still feared that he might not be able to sign,
and Clay was little better pleased. “He said we should make a damned
bad treaty, and he did not know whether he would sign it or not.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
Whatever Adams thought of the treaty, his respect for at least two of
his colleagues was expressed in terms of praise rarely used by him.
Writing to his wife, September 27,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Adams said: “Mr. Gallatin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
keeps and increases his influence over us all. It would have been an
irreparable loss if our country had been deprived of the benefit of his
talents in this negotiation.” At the moment of final suspense he wrote
again, December 16:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Of the five members of the American mission, the Chevalier
[Bayard] has the most perfect control of his temper, the most
deliberate coolness; and it is the more meritorious because it
is real self-command. His feelings are as quick and his spirits
as high as those of any one among us, but he certainly has them
more under government. I can scarcely express to you how much
both he and Mr. Gallatin have risen in my esteem since we have
been here living together. Gallatin has not quite so constant
a supremacy over his own emotions; yet he seldom yields to an
ebullition of temper, and recovers from it immediately. He has a
faculty, when discussion grows too warm, of turning off its edge
by a joke, which I envy him more than all his other talents;
and he has in his character one of the most extraordinary
combinations of stubbornness and of flexibility that I ever
met with in man. His greatest fault I think to be an ingenuity
sometimes trenching upon ingenuousness.”</p>
</div>

<p>Gallatin’s opinion of Adams was not so enthusiastic as Adams’s
admiration for him. He thought Adams’s chief fault to be that he lacked
judgment “to a deplorable degree.”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Of Clay, whether in his merits
or his faults, only one opinion was possible. Clay’s character belonged
to the simple Southern or Virginia type, somewhat affected, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span> not
rendered more complex, by Western influence,—and transparent beyond
need of description or criticism.</p>

<p>The extraordinary patience and judgment of Gallatin, aided by the
steady support of Bayard, carried all the American points without
sacrificing either Adams or Clay, and with no quarrel of serious
importance on any side. When Lord Bathurst received the American note
of December 14, he replied December 19, yielding the last advantage he
possessed:<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> “The Prince Regent regrets to find that there does not
appear any prospect of being able to arrive at such an arrangement with
regard to the fisheries as would have the effect of coming to a full
and satisfactory explanation on that subject;” but since this was the
case, the disputed article might be altogether omitted.</p>

<p>Thus the treaty became simply a cessation of hostilities, leaving
every claim on either side open for future settlement. The formality
of signature was completed December 24, and closed an era of American
history. In substance, the treaty sacrificed much on both sides for
peace. The Americans lost their claims for British spoliations, and
were obliged to admit question of their right to Eastport and their
fisheries in British waters; the British failed to establish their
principles of impressment and blockade, and admitted question of their
right to navigate the Mississippi and trade with the Indians.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span> Perhaps
at the moment the Americans were the chief losers; but they gained
their greatest triumph in referring all their disputes to be settled by
time, the final negotiator, whose decision they could safely trust.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">England</span> received the Treaty of Ghent with feelings of mixed
anger and satisfaction. The “Morning Chronicle” seemed surprised at
the extreme interest which the news excited. As early as November 24,
when ministers made their decision to concede the American terms, the
“Morning Chronicle” announced that “a most extraordinary sensation was
produced yesterday” by news from Ghent, and by reports that ministers
had abandoned their ground. When the treaty arrived, December 26, the
same Whig newspaper, the next morning, while asserting that ministers
had “humbled themselves in the dust and thereby brought discredit on
the country,” heartily approved what they had done; and added that
“the city was in a complete state of hurricane during the whole of
yesterday, but the storm did not attain its utmost height until toward
the evening.... Purchases were made to the extent of many hundred
thousand pounds.” The importance of the United States to England was
made more apparent by the act of peace than by the pressure of war. “At
Birmingham,” said the “Courier,” “an immense assemblage witnessed the
arrival of the mail,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span> and immediately took the horses out, and drew the
mail to the post-office with the loudest acclamations,”—acclamations
over a treaty universally regarded as discreditable.</p>

<p>The “Times” admitted the general joy, and denied only that it was
universal. If the “Times” in any degree represented public opinion,
the popular satisfaction at the peace was an extraordinary political
symptom, for in its opinion the Government had accepted terms such as
“might have been expected from an indulgent and liberal conqueror....
We have retired from the combat,” it said, December 30, “with the
stripes yet bleeding on our back,—with the recent defeats at
Plattsburg and on Lake Champlain unavenged.” During several succeeding
weeks the “Times” continued its extravagant complaints, which served
only to give the Americans a new idea of the triumph they had won.</p>

<p>In truth, no one familiar with English opinion during the past ten
years attempted to deny that the government of England must admit one
or the other of two conclusions,—either it had ruinously mismanaged
its American policy before the war, or it had disgraced itself by the
peace. The “Morning Chronicle,” while approving the treaty, declared
that the Tories were on this point at odds with their own leaders:<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
“Their attachment to the ministers, though strong, cannot reconcile
them to this one step, though surely if they would look back with an
impartial eye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span> on the imbecility and error with which their idols
conducted the war, they must acknowledge their prudence in putting an
end to it. One of them very honestly said, two days ago, that if they
had not put an end to the war, the war would have put an end to their
Ministry.” Whatever doubts existed about the temper of England before
that time, no one doubted after the peace of Ghent that war with the
United States was an unpopular measure with the British people.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the “Times” and the Tories continued their complaints
until March 9, when two simultaneous pieces of news silenced criticism
of the American treaty. The severe defeat at New Orleans became known
at the moment when Napoleon, having quitted Elba, began his triumphal
return to Paris. These news, coming in the midst of Corn Riots,
silenced further discussion of American relations, and left ministers
free to redeem at Waterloo the failures they had experienced in America.</p>

<p>In the United States news of peace was slow to arrive. The British
sloop-of-war “Favorite” bore the despatches, and was still at sea when
the month of February began. The commissioners from Massachusetts
and Connecticut, bearing the demands of the Hartford Convention,
started for Washington. Every one was intent on the situation of New
Orleans, where a disaster was feared. Congress seemed to have abandoned
the attempt to provide means of defence, although it began another
effort to create a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span> bank on Dallas’s plan. A large number of the most
intelligent citizens believed that two announcements would soon be
made,—one, that New Orleans was lost; the other, that the negotiation
at Ghent had ended in rupture. Under this double shock, the collapse of
the national government seemed to its enemies inevitable.</p>

<p>In this moment of suspense, the first news arrived from New Orleans.
To the extreme relief of the Government and the Republican majority
in Congress, they learned, February 4, that the British invasion
was defeated and New Orleans saved. The victory was welcomed by
illuminations, votes of thanks, and rejoicings greater than had
followed the more important success at Plattsburg, or the more
brilliant battles at Niagara; for the success won at New Orleans
relieved the Government from a load of anxiety, and postponed a
crisis supposed to be immediately at hand. Half the influence of
the Hartford Convention was destroyed by it; and the commissioners,
who were starting for the capital, had reason to expect a reception
less favorable by far than they would have met had the British been
announced as masters of Louisiana. Yet the immediate effect of the
news was not to lend new vigor to Congress, but rather to increase its
inertness, and to encourage its dependence on militia, Treasury notes,
and good fortune.</p>

<p>A week afterward, on the afternoon of Saturday, February 11, the
British sloop-of-war “Favorite”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span> sailed up New York harbor, and the
city quickly heard rumors of peace. At eight o’clock that evening the
American special messenger landed, bringing the official documents
intrusted to his care; and when the news could no longer be doubted,
the city burst into an uproar of joy. The messenger was slow in
reaching Washington, where he arrived only on the evening of Tuesday,
February 13, and delivered his despatches to the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>Had the treaty been less satisfactory than it was, the President would
have hesitated long before advising its rejection, and the Senate
could hardly have gained courage to reject it. In spite of rumors from
London and significant speculations on the London Exchange, known
in America in the middle of January, no one had seriously counted
on a satisfactory peace, as was proved by the steady depression
of government credit and of the prices of American staples. The
reaction after the arrival of the news was natural, and so violent
that few persons stopped to scrutinize the terms. Contrary to Clay’s
forebodings, the treaty, mere armistice though it seemed to be, was
probably the most popular treaty ever negotiated by the United States.
The President sent it to the Senate February 15; and the next day,
without suggestion of amendment, and apparently without a criticism,
unless from Federalists, the Senate unanimously confirmed it,
thirty-five senators uniting in approval.</p>

<p>Yet the treaty was not what the Government had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span> expected in declaring
the war, or such as it had a right to demand. The Republicans admitted
it in private, and the Federalists proclaimed it in the press.
Senator Gore wrote to Governor Strong:<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> “The treaty must be deemed
disgraceful to the Government who made the war and the peace, and will
be so adjudged by all, after the first effusions of joy at relief have
subsided.” Opinions differed widely on the question where the disgrace
belonged,—whether to the Government who made the war, or to the people
who refused to support it; but no one pretended that the terms of
peace, as far as they were expressed in the treaty, were so good as
those repeatedly offered by England more than two years before. Yet the
treaty was universally welcomed, and not a thought of continued war
found expression.</p>

<p>In New England the peace was received with extravagant delight. While
the government messenger who carried the official news to Washington
made no haste, a special messenger started from New York at ten o’clock
Saturday night, immediately on the landing of the government messenger,
and in thirty-two hours arrived in Boston. Probably the distance
had rarely been travelled in less time, for the Boston “Centinel”
announced the expense to be two hundred and twenty-five dollars; and
such an outlay was seldom made for rapidity of travel or news. As the
messenger passed from town to town he announced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span> the tidings to the
delighted people.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Reaching the “Centinel” office, at Boston, early
Monday morning, he delivered his bulletin, and a few minutes after it
was published all the bells were set ringing; schools and shops were
closed, and a general holiday taken; flags were hoisted, the British
with the American; the militia paraded, and in the evening the city was
illuminated. Yet the terms of peace were wholly unknown, and the people
of Massachusetts had every reason to fear that their interests were
sacrificed for the safety of the Union. Their rejoicing over the peace
was as unreasoning as their hatred of the war.</p>

<p>Only along the Canadian frontier where the farmers had for three years
made large profits by supplying both armies, the peace was received
without rejoicing.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> South of New York, although less public
delight was expressed, the relief was probably greater than in New
England. Virginia had suffered most, and had felt the blockade with
peculiar severity. A few weeks before the treaty was signed, Jefferson
wrote:<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“By the total annihilation in value of the produce which
was to give me sustenance and independence, I shall be like
Tantalus,—up to the shoulders in water, yet dying with thirst.
We can make indeed enough to eat, drink, and clothe ourselves,
but nothing for our salt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span> iron, groceries, and taxes which
must be paid in money. For what can we raise for the market?
Wheat?—we only give it to our horses, as we have been doing
ever since harvest. Tobacco?—it is not worth the pipe it is
smoked in.”</p>
</div>

<p>While all Virginia planters were in this situation February 13, they
awoke February 14 to find flour worth ten dollars a barrel, and
groceries fallen fifty per cent. They were once more rich beyond their
wants.</p>

<p>So violent and sudden a change in values had never been known in the
United States. The New York market saw fortunes disappear and other
fortunes created in the utterance of a single word. All imported
articles dropped to low prices. Sugar which sold Saturday at twenty-six
dollars a hundred-weight, sold Monday at twelve dollars and a half. Tea
sank from two dollars and a quarter to one dollar a pound; tin fell
from eighty to twenty-five dollars a box; cotton fabrics declined about
fifty per cent. On the other hand flour, cotton, and the other chief
staples of American produce rose in the same proportion. Nominally
flour was worth seven and a half dollars on Saturday, though no large
amounts could have been sold; on Monday the price was ten dollars, and
all the wheat in the country was soon sold at that rate.</p>

<p>Owing to the derangement of currency, these prices expressed no precise
specie value. The effect of the peace on the currency was for a moment
to restore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span> an apparent equilibrium. In New York the specie premium
of twenty-two per cent was imagined for a time to have vanished. In
truth, United States six-per-cents rose in New York from seventy-six to
eighty-eight in paper; Treasury-notes from ninety-two to ninety-eight.
In Philadelphia, on Saturday, six-per-cents sold at seventy-five; on
Monday, at ninety-three. The paper depreciation remained about twenty
per cent in New York, about twenty-four per cent in Philadelphia, and
about thirty per cent in Baltimore. The true value of six-per-cents was
about sixty-eight; of Treasury notes about seventy-eight, after the
announcement of peace.</p>

<p>As rapidly as possible the blockade was raised, and ships were hurried
to sea with the harvests of three seasons for cargo; but some weeks
still passed before all the operations of war were closed. The news
of peace reached the British squadron below Mobile in time to prevent
further advance on that place; but on the ocean a long time elapsed
before fighting wholly ceased.</p>

<p>Some of the worst disasters as well as the greatest triumphs of the war
occurred after the treaty of peace had been signed. The battle of New
Orleans was followed by the loss of Fort Bowyer. At about the same time
a British force occupied Cumberland Island on the southern edge of the
Georgia coast, and January 13 attacked the fort at the entrance of the
St. Mary’s, and having captured it without loss, ascended the river the
next day to the town of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span> St. Mary’s, which they seized, together with
its merchandise and valuable ships in the river. Cockburn established
his headquarters on Cumberland Island January 22, and threw the whole
State of Georgia into agitation, while he waited the arrival of a
brigade with which an attack was to be made on Savannah.</p>

<p>The worst disaster of the naval war occurred January 15, when
the frigate “President”—one of the three American forty-fours,
under Stephen Decatur, the favorite ocean hero of the American
service—suffered defeat and capture within fifty miles of Sandy Hook.
No naval battle of the war was more disputed in its merits, although
its occurrence in the darkest moments of national depression was almost
immediately forgotten in the elation of the peace a few days later.</p>

<p>Secretary Jones retired from the Navy Department Dec. 19, 1814,
yielding the direction to B. W. Crowninshield of Massachusetts, but
leaving a squadron ready for sea at New York under orders for distant
service. The “Peacock” and “Hornet,” commanded by Warrington and
Biddle, were to sail with a store-ship on a long cruise in Indian
waters, where they were expected to ravage British shipping from the
Cape of Good Hope to the China seas. With them Decatur was to go
in the “President,” and at the beginning of the new year he waited
only an opportunity to slip to sea past the blockading squadron.
January 14 a strong westerly wind drove the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span> fleet out of
sight. The “President” set sail, but in crossing the bar at night
grounded, and continued for an hour or more to strike heavily, until
the tide and strong wind forced her across. Decatur then ran along
the Long Island coast some fifty miles, when he changed his course
to the southeast, hoping that he had evaded the blockading squadron.
This course was precisely that which Captain Hayes, commanding the
squadron, expected;<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> and an hour before daylight the four British
ships, standing to the northward and eastward, sighted the “President,”
standing to the southward and eastward, not more than two miles on the
weather-bow of the “Majestic,”—the fifty-six-gun razee commanded by
Captain Hayes.</p>

<p>The British ships promptly made chase. Captain Hayes’s squadron,
besides the “Majestic,” consisted of the “Endymion,” a fifty-gun
frigate, with the “Pomone” and “Tenedos,” frigates like the
“Guerriere,” “Macedonian,” and “Java,” armed with eighteen-pound guns.
Only from the “Endymion” had Decatur much to fear, for the “Majestic”
was slow and the other ships were weak; but the “Endymion” was a
fast sailer, and especially adapted to meet the American frigates.
The “Endymion,” according to British authority, was about one
hundred and fifty-nine feet in length on the lower deck, and nearly
forty-three feet in extreme breadth; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span> “President,” on the same
authority, was about one hundred and seventy-three feet in length, and
forty-four feet in breadth. The “Endymion” carried twenty-six long
twenty-four-pounders on the main deck; the “President” carried thirty.
The “Endymion” mounted twenty-two thirty-two pound carronades on the
spar deck; the “President” mounted twenty. The “Endymion” had also a
long brass eighteen-pounder as a bow-chaser; the “President” a long
twenty-four-pounder as a bow-chaser, and another as a stern-chaser. The
“Endymion” was short-handed after her losses in action with the “Prince
de Neufchatel,” and carried only three hundred and forty-six men; the
“President” carried four hundred and fifty. The “Endymion” was the
weaker ship, probably in the proportion of four to five; but for her
immediate purpose she possessed a decisive advantage in superior speed,
especially in light winds.</p>

<p>At two o’clock in the afternoon, the “Endymion” had gained so much
on the “President” as to begin exchanging shots between the stern
and bow-chasers.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Soon after five o’clock, as the wind fell, the
“Endymion” crept up on the “President’s” starboard quarter, and
“commenced close action.”<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> After bearing the enemy’s fire for half
an hour without reply, Decatur was obliged to alter his course and
accept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span> battle, or suffer himself to be crippled.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> The battle lasted
two hours and a half, until eight o’clock, when firing ceased; but at
half-past nine, according to the “Pomone’s” log, the “Endymion” fired
two guns, which the “President” returned with one.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> According to
Decatur’s account the “Endymion” lay for half an hour under his stern,
without firing, while the “President” was trying to escape. In truth
the “Endymion” had no need to fire; she was busy bending new sails,
while Decatur’s ship, according to his official report, was crippled,
and in the want of wind could not escape.</p>

<p>In a letter written by Decatur to his wife immediately after the
battle, he gave an account of what followed, as he understood it.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The ‘Endymion,’” he began, ... “was the leading ship of the
enemy. She got close under my quarters and was cutting my
rigging without my being able to bring a gun to bear upon
her. To suffer this was making my capture certain, and that
too without injury to the enemy. I therefore bore up for the
‘Endymion’ and engaged her for two hours, when we silenced and
beat her off. At this time the rest of the ships had got within
two miles of us. We made all the sail we could from them, but
it was in vain. In three hours the ‘Pomone’ and ‘Tenedos’ were
alongside, and the ‘Majestic’ and ‘Endymion’ close to us. All
that was now left for me to do was to receive the fire of the
nearest ship and surrender.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span></p>

<p>The “Pomone’s” account of the surrender completed the story:<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At eleven, being within gunshot of the ‘President’ who was
still steering to the eastward under a press of sail, with
royal, top-gallant, topmast, and lower studding-sails set,
finding how much we outsailed her our studding-sails were taken
in, and immediately afterward we luffed to port and fired
our starboard broadside. The enemy then also luffed to port,
bringing his larboard broadside to bear, which was momentarily
expected, as a few minutes previous to our closing her she
hoisted a light abaft, which in night actions constitutes the
ensign. Our second broadside was fired, and the ‘President’
still luffing up as if intent to lay us on board, we hauled
close to port, bracing the yards up, and setting the mainsail;
the broadside was again to be fired into his bows, raking, when
she hauled down the light, and we hailed demanding if she had
surrendered. The reply was in the affirmative, and the firing
immediately ceased. The ‘Tenedos,’ who was not more than three
miles off, soon afterward came up, and assisted the ‘Pomone’ in
securing the prize and removing the prisoners. At three quarters
past twelve the ‘Endymion’ came up, and the ‘Majestic’ at three
in the morning.”</p>
</div>

<p>Between the account given by Decatur and that of the “Pomone’s” log
were some discrepancies. In the darkness many mistakes were inevitable;
but if each party were taken as the best authority on its own side,
the connected story seemed to show that Decatur, after beating off
the “Endymion,” made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span> every effort to escape, but was impressed by
the conviction that if overtaken by the squadron, nothing was left
but to receive the fire of the nearest ship, and surrender. The night
was calm, and the “President” made little headway. At eleven o’clock
one of the pursuing squadron came up, and fired two broadsides.
“Thus situated,” reported Decatur, “with about one fifth of my crew
killed and wounded, my ship crippled, and a more than fourfold force
opposed to me, without a chance of escape left, I deemed it my duty to
surrender.”</p>

<p>The official Court of Inquiry on the loss of the “President” reported,
a few months afterward, a warm approval of Decatur’s conduct:<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We fear that we cannot express in a manner that will do
justice to our feelings our admiration of the conduct of
Commodore Decatur and his officers and crew.... As well during
the chase as through his contest with the enemy [he] evinced
great judgment and skill, perfect coolness, the most determined
resolution, and heroic courage.”</p>
</div>

<p>The high praise thus bestowed was doubtless deserved, since the Court
of Inquiry was composed of persons well qualified to judge; but
Decatur’s battle with the “Endymion” was far from repeating the success
of his triumph over the “Macedonian.” Anxious to escape rather than
to fight, Decatur in consequence failed either to escape or resist
with effect. The action with the “Endymion” lasted three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span> hours from
the time when the British frigate gained the “President’s” quarter.
For the first half hour the “President” received the “Endymion’s”
broadsides without reply. During the last half hour the firing
slackened and became intermittent. Yet for two hours the ships were
engaged at close range, a part of the time within half musket-shot, in
a calm sea, and in a parallel line of sailing.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> At all times of the
battle, the ships were well within point-blank range,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> which for
long twenty-four-pounders and thirty-two-pound carronades was about
two hundred and fifty yards.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Decatur had needed but an hour and a
half to disable and capture the “Macedonian,” although a heavy swell
disturbed his fire, and at no time were the ships within easy range for
grape, which was about one hundred and fifty yards. The “Endymion” was
a larger and better ship than the “Macedonian,” but the “President” was
decidedly less efficient than the “United States.”</p>

<p>According to Captain Hope’s report, the “Endymion” lost eleven men
killed and fourteen wounded. The “President” reported twenty-five
killed and sixty wounded. Of the two ships the “President” was probably
the most severely injured.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> The masts of both were damaged, and
two days afterward both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span> were dismasted in a gale; but while the
“President” lost all her masts by the board, the “Endymion” lost only
her fore and main masts considerably above deck. On the whole, the
injury inflicted by the “President” on the “Endymion” was less than in
proportion to her relative strength, or to the length of time occupied
in the action. Even on the supposition that the “President’s” fire was
directed chiefly against the “Endymion’s” rigging, the injury done
was not proportional to the time occupied in doing it. According to
the “Pomone’s” log, the “Endymion” was able to rejoin the squadron at
quarter before one o’clock in the night. According to the “Endymion’s”
log, she repaired damages in an hour, and resumed the chase at nine
o’clock.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>The British ships were surprised that Decatur should have surrendered
to the “Pomone” without firing a shot. Apparently the “Pomone’s”
broadside did little injury, and the “Tenedos” was not yet in range
when the “Pomone” opened fire. The question of the proper time to
surrender was to be judged by professional rules; and if resistance
was hopeless, Decatur was doubtless justified in striking when he did;
but his apparent readiness to do so hardly accorded with the popular
conception of his character.</p>

<p>As usual the sloops were more fortunate than the frigate, and got to
sea successfully, January 22, in a gale of wind which enabled them to
run the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span> blockade. Their appointed rendezvous was Tristan d’Acunha.
There the “Hornet” arrived on the morning of March 23, and before she
had time to anchor sighted the British sloop-of-war “Penguin,”—a new
brig then cruising in search of the American privateer “Young Wasp.”</p>

<p>Captain Biddle of the “Hornet” instantly made chase, and Captain
Dickinson of the “Penguin” bore up and stood for the enemy. According
to British authority the vessels differed only by a “trifling
disparity of force.”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> In truth the American was somewhat superior
in size, metal, and crew, although not so decisively as in most of
the sloop battles. The “Hornet” carried eighteen thirty-two-pound
carronades and two long twelve-pounders; the “Penguin” carried sixteen
thirty-two-pound carronades, two long guns differently reported as
twelve-pounders and six-pounders, and a twelve-pound carronade. The
crews were apparently the same in number,—about one hundred and
thirty-two men. Captain Dickinson had equipped his vessel especially
for the purpose of capturing heavy privateers, and was then looking for
the “Young Wasp,”—a vessel decidedly superior to the “Hornet.”<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
Although he had reason to doubt his ability to capture the “Young
Wasp,” he did not fear a combat with the “Hornet,” and showed his
confidence by brushing up close alongside and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span> firing a gun, while the
“Hornet,” all aback, waited for him.</p>

<p>The result was very different from that of Decatur’s two-hour battle
with the “Endymion.” In little more than twenty minutes of close action
the “Penguin’s” foremast and bowsprit were gone, her captain killed,
and thirty-eight men killed or wounded, or more than one fourth the
crew. The brig was “a perfect wreck,” according to the British official
report, when the senior surviving officer hailed and surrendered.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
The “Hornet” was not struck in the hull, but was very much cut up
in rigging and spars. She had two killed, and nine wounded. “It was
evident,” said Captain Biddle’s report, “that our fire was greatly
superior both in quickness and effect.”</p>

<p>The “Penguin” was destroyed, and the “Hornet” and “Peacock” continued
their cruise until April 27, when they chased for twenty-four
hours a strange sail, which proved to be the British seventy-four
“Cornwallis.” On discovering the character of the chase Biddle made
off to windward, but found that the enemy “sailed remarkably fast and
was very weatherly.” At daylight of the 29th, the “Cornwallis” was
within gunshot on the “Hornet’s” lee-quarter. Her shot did not take
effect, and Biddle, by lightening his ship, drew out of fire; but a few
hours later the enemy again came up within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span> three quarters of a mile,
in a calm sea, and opened once more. Three shot struck the “Hornet,”
but without crippling her. Biddle threw over everything that could be
spared, except one long gun; and a fortunate change of wind enabled him
a second time to creep out of fire. He escaped; but the loss of his
guns, anchors, cables, and boats obliged him to make for San Salvador,
where he heard the news of peace.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>Captain Warrington in the “Peacock” continued his cruise to the Indian
Ocean, and captured four Indiamen. In the Straits of Sunda, June 30,
he encountered a small East India Company’s cruiser, whose commander
hailed and announced peace. Warrington replied, “directing him at
the same time to haul his colors down if it were the case, in token
of it,—adding that if he did not, I should fire into him.” The brig
refused to strike its colors, and Warrington nearly destroyed her by a
broadside.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> For this violence little excuse could be offered, for
the “Nautilus” was not half the “Peacock’s” strength, and could not
have escaped. Warrington, like most officers of the American navy,
remembered the “Chesapeake” too well.</p>

<p>The cruise of the “President,” “Peacock,” and “Hornet” ended in the
loss of the “President,” the disabling of the “Hornet,” and the
arrival of the “Peacock” alone at the point intended for their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span> common
cruising-ground. No other national vessels were at sea after peace was
signed, except the “Constitution,” which late in December sailed from
Boston under the command of Captain Charles Stewart,—a Philadelphian
of Irish descent, not thirty-nine years old, but since 1806 a captain
in the United States service.</p>

<p>Cruising between Gibraltar and Madeira, at about one o’clock on the
afternoon of February 20 Captain Stewart discovered two sail ahead,
which he chased and overtook at six o’clock. Both were ship-rigged
sloops-of-war. The larger of the two was the “Cyane.” Americans
preferred to call her a frigate, but that designation, though vague
at best, could hardly be applied to such a vessel. The “Cyane” was
a frigate-built sloop-of-war, or corvette, like the “Little Belt,”
carrying a regular complement of one hundred and eighty-five men. Her
length on the lower deck was one hundred and eighteen feet; her breadth
was thirty-two feet. She carried thirty-three guns, all carronades
except two long-nines or twelves. Her companion, the “Levant,” was also
a sloop-of-war of the larger sort, though smaller than the “Cyane.” She
mounted twenty-one guns, all carronades except two long nine-pounders.
Her regular crew was one hundred and thirty-five men and boys.</p>

<p>Either separately or together the British ships were decidedly unequal
to the “Constitution,” which could, by remaining at long range, sink
them both without receiving a shot in return. The “Constitution”
carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span> thirty-two long twenty-four-pounders; while the two sloops
could reply to these guns only by four long nine-pounders. The
“Constitution” carried four hundred and fifty men; the two sloops at
the time of the encounter carried three hundred and thirty-six seamen,
marines, and officers.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> The “Constitution” was built of great
strength; the two sloops had only the frames of their class. The utmost
that the British captains could hope was that one of the two vessels
might escape by the sacrifice of the other.</p>

<p>Instead of escaping, the senior officer, Captain George Douglass of the
“Levant,” resolved to engage the frigate, “in the hopes, by disabling
her, to prevent her intercepting two valuable convoys that sailed from
Gibraltar about the same time as the ‘Levant’ and ‘Cyane.’”<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Captain
Douglass knew his relative strength, for he had heard that the American
frigate was on his course.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Yet he seriously expected to disable
her, and made a courageous attempt to do so.</p>

<p>The two ships, close together, tried first for the weather-gauge, but
the “Constitution” outsailed them also on that point. They then bore up
in hope of delaying the engagement till night, but the “Constitution”
overhauled them too rapidly for the success<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span> of that plan. They then
stood on the starboard tack, the “Cyane” astern, the “Levant” a
half-cable length ahead, while the “Constitution” came up to windward
and opened fire. Commodore Stewart’s report described the result:<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At five minutes past six ranged up on the starboard side of the
sternmost ship [the ‘Cyane’], about three hundred yards distant,
and commenced the action by broadsides,—both ships returning
our fire with great spirit for about fifteen minutes. Then the
fire of the enemy beginning to slacken, and the great column of
smoke collected under our lee, induced us to cease our fire to
ascertain their positions and conditions. In about three minutes
the smoke clearing away, we found ourselves abreast of the
headmost ship [the ‘Levant’], the sternmost ship luffing up for
our larboard quarter.”</p>
</div>

<p>Three hundred yards was a long range for carronades, especially in
British sloops whose marksmanship was indifferent at best. According to
the British court-martial on the officers of the “Cyane” and “Levant,”
their carronades had little effect.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> If Stewart managed his ship
as his duty required, the two sloops until that moment should have
been allowed to make little effective return of the “Constitution’s”
broadside of sixteen twenty-four-pounders except by two nine-pounders.
They were in the position of the “Essex” at Valparaiso. The “Cyane”
naturally luffed up, in order to bring her carronades<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span> to bear, but she
was already cut to pieces, and made the matter worse by closing.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We poured a broadside into the headmost ship,” continued the
American account, “and then braced aback our main and mizzen
topsails and backed astern under cover of the smoke abreast the
sternmost ship, when the action was continued with spirit and
considerable effect until thirty-five minutes past six, when the
enemy’s fire again slackened.”</p>
</div>

<p>The “Levant,” after receiving two stern-raking fires, bore up at forty
minutes past six and began to repair damages two miles to leeward.
The “Cyane,” having become unmanageable, struck at ten minutes before
seven. The most remarkable incident of the battle occurred after the
“Cyane” struck, when the “Constitution” went after the “Levant” which
was in sight to leeward. The little “Levant,” instead of running away,
stood directly for the huge American frigate, more than three times
her size, and ranging close alongside fired a broadside into her as
the two ships passed on opposite tacks. Although the sloop received
the “Constitution’s” broadside in return, she was only captured at
last after an hour’s chase, at ten o’clock, much cut up in spars and
rigging, but still sea-worthy, and with seven men killed and sixteen
wounded, or only one casualty to six of her crew.</p>

<p>In truth, the injury inflicted by the “Constitution’s” fire was not so
great as might have been expected. The “Cyane” lost twelve killed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
twenty-six wounded, if the American report was correct. Neither ship
was dismasted or in a sinking condition. Both arrived safely, March 10,
at Porto Praya. On the other hand, the “Constitution” was struck eleven
times in the hull, and lost three men killed and twelve wounded, three
of the latter mortally. She suffered more than in her battle with the
“Guerriere,”—a result creditable to the British ships, considering
that in each case the “Constitution” could choose her own range.</p>

<p>Stewart took his prizes to the Cape de Verde Islands. At noon, March
11, while lying in port at Porto Praya, three British frigates
appeared off the harbor, and Stewart instantly stood to sea, passing
the enemy’s squadron to windward within gunshot. The three frigates
made chase, and at one o’clock, as the “Cyane” was dropping astern,
Stewart signalled to her to tack ship, and either escape, if not
pursued, or return to Porto Praya. The squadron paid no attention to
the “Cyane,” but followed the “Constitution” and “Levant.” At three
o’clock, the “Levant” falling behind, Stewart signalled her also to
tack. Immediately the whole British squadron abandoned pursuit of the
“Constitution” and followed the “Levant” to Porto Praya, where they
seized her under the guns of the Portuguese batteries. Meanwhile the
“Constitution” and “Cyane” escaped, and reached the United States
without further accident. The extraordinary blunders of the British
squadron were never satisfactorily explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span></p>

<p>These combats and cruises, with the last ravages of the privateers,
closed the war on the ocean as it had long ceased on land; and
meanwhile the people of the United States had turned their energies to
undertakings of a wholly different character.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> long, exciting, and splendid panorama of revolution and
war, which for twenty-five years absorbed the world’s attention and
dwarfed all other interests, vanished more quickly in America than in
Europe, and left fewer elements of disturbance. The transformation
scene of a pantomime was hardly more sudden or complete than the
change that came over the United States at the announcement of peace.
In a single day, almost in a single instant, the public turned from
interests and passions that had supplied its thought for a generation,
and took up a class of ideas that had been unknown or but vaguely
defined before.</p>

<p>At Washington the effect of the news was so extraordinary as to shake
faith in the seriousness of party politics. Although the peace affected
in no way party doctrine or social distinctions, a new epoch for the
Union began from the evening of February 13, when the messenger from
Ghent arrived with the treaty. No one stopped to ask why a government,
which was discredited and falling to pieces at one moment, should
appear as a successful and even a glorious national representative a
moment afterward.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span> Politicians dismissed the war from their thoughts,
as they dismissed the treaty, with the single phrase: “Not an inch
ceded or lost!”<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The commissioners from Massachusetts and
Connecticut who appeared at Washington with the recommendations of the
Hartford Convention, returned home as quietly as possible, pursued by
the gibes of the press. The war was no more popular then than it had
been before, as the subsequent elections proved; but the danger was
passed, and passion instantly subsided.</p>

<p>Only by slow degrees the country learned to appreciate the
extraordinary feat which had been performed, not so much by the
people as by a relatively small number of individuals. Had a village
rustic, with one hand tied behind his back, challenged the champion of
the prize-ring, and in three or four rounds obliged him to draw the
stakes, the result would have been little more surprising than the
result of the American campaign of 1814. The most intelligent and best
educated part of society both in the United States and in Great Britain
could not believe it, and the true causes of British defeat remained
a subject of conjecture and angry dispute. The enemies of the war
admitted only that peace had saved Madison; but this single concession,
which included many far-reaching consequences, was granted instantly,
and from that moment the national government triumphed over all its
immediate dangers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span></p>

<p>While the Senate unanimously ratified the treaty February 16, the House
set to work with much more alacrity than was its habit to dispose of
the business before it. Haste was necessary. Barely fourteen days
remained before the Thirteenth Congress should expire, and in that
interval some system of peace legislation must be adopted. The struggle
over the proposed Bank charter was still raging, for the Senate had
passed another bill of incorporation February 11, over which the House
was occupied the whole day of February 13 in a sharp and close contest.
The first effect of the peace was to stop this struggle. By a majority
of one vote, seventy-four to seventy-three, February 17, the House laid
the subject aside.</p>

<p>Three days afterward, February 20, the President sent to Congress
a Message transmitting the treaty with its ratifications, and
congratulating the country on the close of a war “waged with the
success which is the natural result of the wisdom of the legislative
councils, of the patriotism of the people, of the public spirit of
the militia, and of the valor of the military and naval forces of the
country.” After recommending to Congress the interests of the soldiers
and sailors, the Message passed to the reduction of expenditures, which
required immediate attention:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There are, however,” continued Madison, “important
considerations which forbid a sudden and general revocation of
the measures that have been produced by the war. Experience
has taught us that neither the pacific dispositions of the
American people, nor the pacific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span> character of their political
institutions, can altogether exempt them from that strife which
appears, beyond the ordinary lot of nations, to be incident to
the actual period of the world; and the same faithful monitor
demonstrates that a certain degree of preparation for war is not
only indispensable to avert disasters in the onset, but affords
also the best security for the continuance of peace.”</p>
</div>

<p>The avowal that experience had shown the error of the principle
adopted by the nation in 1801 was not confined to President Madison.
Monroe spoke even more plainly. In a letter to the military committee,
February 24, Monroe urged that an army of twenty thousand men should be
retained on the peace establishment. Each soldier of the rank-and-file
was supposed to cost in peace about two hundred dollars a year, and
Monroe’s proposal involved an annual expense of more than five million
dollars.</p>

<p>As far as concerned Madison and Monroe the repudiation of old
Republican principles seemed complete; but the people had moved less
rapidly than their leaders. Had Congress, while debating the subject
February 25, known that Napoleon was then quitting Elba to seize once
more the control of France, and to rouse another European convulsion
with all its possible perils to neutrals, the President’s views might
have been adopted without serious dispute; but in the absence of
evident danger, an army of twenty thousand men seemed unnecessary. The
finances warranted no such extravagance. Dallas wrote to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span> Eppes, the
chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, a letter<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> dated February
20, sketching a temporary financial scheme for the coming year. He
proposed to fund at seven per cent the outstanding Treasury notes,
amounting to $18,637,000; and even after thus sweeping the field clear
of pressing claims, he still required the extravagant war-taxes in
order to meet expenses, and depended on a further issue of Treasury
notes, or a loan, to support the peace establishments of the army and
navy. The state of the currency was desperate, and the revenue for the
year 1815 was estimated at $18,200,000 in the notes of State banks,—a
sum little in excess of the estimated civil necessities.</p>

<p>The military committee of the House showed no sympathy with the new
principles urged upon Congress by the Executive. Troup of Georgia
reported a bill, February 22, fixing the peace establishment at
ten thousand men, with two major-generals and four brigadiers. In
submitting this proposal, Troup urged the House, February 25, to
accept the reduction to ten thousand as the lowest possible standard,
requiring only the expense of two and a half millions; but no sooner
did he take his seat than Desha of Kentucky moved to substitute “six”
for “ten,” and a vigorous debate followed, ending in the adoption of
Desha’s amendment in committee by a majority of nineteen votes. The
war leaders were greatly annoyed by this new triumph of the peace
party. As a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span> matter of principle, the vote on Desha’s amendment
affirmed Jefferson’s pacific system and condemned the Federalist
heresies of Madison and Monroe. The war leaders could not acquiesce in
such a decision, and rallying for another effort, February 27, they
remonstrated hotly. Forsyth of Georgia was particularly emphatic in
defining the issue:<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He had hoped that the spirit of calculation falsely styled
economy, whose contracted view was fixed upon present expense,
and was incapable of enlarging it to permanent and eventual
advantage, had been laid forever by the powerful exorcisms of
reason and experience. It would seem however that it had been
only lulled by the presence of a more powerful demon. Since the
potent spell of necessity had been broken, the troubled spirit
of petty calculation was again awakened to vex the counsels and
destroy the best hopes of the country.”</p>
</div>

<p>For three years the friends of strong government, under the pressure
of war, had been able to drive Congress more or less in their own
direction; but at the announcement of peace their power was greatly
lessened, and their unwilling associates were no longer disposed to
follow their lead or to tolerate their assumptions of superiority.
Desha retaliated in the tone of 1798:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Do they suppose that the House do not understand the subject;
or do they suppose that by this great flow of eloquence they
can make the substantial part of the House change the opinions
in so short a time? When I speak of the substantial part of the
House, I mean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span> those who think much and speak but little; who
make common-sense their guide, and not theoretical or visionary
projects.... Some gentlemen advocate ten thousand and others
twenty thousand of a standing army. The policy is easy to be
seen through. The advocates of a perpetual system of taxation
discover that if they cannot retain a considerable standing
army, they will have no good plea for riveting the present taxes
on the people.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the process of national growth, public opinion had advanced since
1801 several stages in its development; but the speeches of Forsyth,
Calhoun, and Lowndes on one side, like that of Desha on the other,
left still in doubt the amount of change. While Forsyth admitted that
he had under-estimated the strength of the economical spirit, Desha
certainly over-estimated the force of the men “who think much and
speak but little.” With Federalist assistance, Desha’s friends passed
the bill for an army of six thousand men by a vote of seventy-five
to sixty-five; but the Senate, by a more decided vote of eighteen to
ten, substituted “fifteen” for “six.” With this amendment the bill
was returned to the House March 2, which by an almost unanimous vote
refused to concur. The bill was sent to a conference committee, which
reported the original plan of ten thousand men; and in the last hours
of the session, March 3, the House yielded. By a vote of seventy to
thirty-eight the peace establishment was fixed at ten thousand men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span></p>

<p>The movement of public opinion was more evident in regard to the navy.
Instead of repeating the experiments of 1801, Congress maintained
the whole war establishment, and appropriated four million dollars
chiefly for the support of frigates and ships-of-the-line. The vessels
on the Lakes were dismantled and laid up; the gunboats, by an Act
approved February 27, were ordered to be sold; but the sum of two
hundred thousand dollars was appropriated for the annual purchase
of ship-timber during the next three years, and the whole navy
thenceforward consisted of cruisers, which were to be kept as far as
possible in active service. As the first task of the new ships, an Act,
approved March 3, authorized hostilities against the Dey of Algiers,
who had indulged in the plunder of American commerce.</p>

<p>These hasty arrangements for the two services, coupled with an equally
hasty financial makeshift, completed the career of the Thirteenth
Congress, which expired March 4, as little admired or regretted as
the least popular of its predecessors. Not upon Congress but upon the
Executive Departments fell the burden of peace as of war, and on the
Executive the new situation brought many embarrassments.</p>

<p>The first and most delicate task of the Government was the reduction
of the army. No one could greatly blame Monroe for shrinking from the
invidious duty of dismissing two thirds of the small force which had
sustained so well and with so little support the character of the
country; but the haste which he showed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span> in leaving the War Department
suggested also how keenly he must have suffered under its burdens.
His name was sent to the Senate, February 27, as Secretary of State;
no Secretary of War was nominated, but Dallas, with the courage that
marked his character, undertook to manage the War Department as well as
the Treasury until the necessary arrangements for the new army should
be made.</p>

<p>April 8 Dallas wrote to six generals,—Brown, Jackson, Scott, Gaines,
Macomb, and Ripley,—requesting their attendance at Washington to
report a plan for the new army. Jackson and Gaines were unable
to attend. The rest of the board reported a scheme dividing the
country into two military districts, north and south; and into
nine departments, five in the northern, four in the southern
division,—allotting to each the troops needed for its service. May
17 the new arrangements were announced. Brown was ordered to command
the northern district, with Ripley and Macomb as brigadiers. Jackson
took the southern district, with Scott and Gaines as brigadiers. Eight
regiments of infantry, one of riflemen, and one of light artillery were
retained, together with the corps of artillery and engineers. As far as
possible, all the officers whose names became famous for a generation
received rank and reward.</p>

<p>No such operation was necessary for the navy, where no reduction was
required. In the civil service, Madison enjoyed the satisfaction of
rewarding the friends who had stood by him in his trials. February<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
27 he sent to the Senate, with the nomination of Monroe as Secretary
of State, the name of J. Q. Adams as Minister to England. At the same
time Bayard was appointed to St. Petersburg, and Gallatin to Paris. The
nomination of Bayard proved to be an empty compliment, for he arrived,
August 1, in the Delaware River, in the last stages of illness, and was
carried ashore the next day only to die.</p>

<p>These appointments were well received and readily confirmed by the
Senate; but Madison carried favoritism too far for the Senate’s
approval when, March 1, he nominated Major-General Dearborn to be
Secretary of War. Dearborn had few or no enemies, but the distinction
thus shown him roused such strong remonstrance that Madison hastened to
recall the nomination, and substituted Crawford in Dearborn’s place.
The Senate had already rejected Dearborn, but consented to erase the
record from their journal,<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and Crawford became Secretary of War.</p>

<p>Thus the government in all its branches glided into the new conditions,
hampered only by the confusion of the currency, which could not be
overcome. The people were even more quick than the government to adapt
themselves to peace. In New Orleans alone a few weeks of alarm were
caused by extraordinary acts of arbitrary power on the part of General
Jackson during the interval before the peace became officially known;
but public order was not seriously disturbed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span> and the civil authority
was restored March 13. Elsewhere the country scarcely stopped to notice
the cost or the consequences of the war.</p>

<p>In truth the cost was moderate. Measured by loss of life in battle, it
was less than that reported in many single battles fought by Napoleon.
An army which never exceeded thirty thousand effectives, or placed more
than four thousand regular rank-and-file in a single action, could not
sacrifice many lives. According to the received estimates the number
of men killed in battle on land did not much exceed fifteen hundred,
including militia, while the total of killed and wounded little
exceeded five thousand.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Sickness was more fatal than wounds, but
a population of eight millions felt camp-diseases hardly more than its
periodical malarial fevers.</p>

<p>The precise financial cost of the war, measured only by increase of
debt, was equally moderate. During three years,—from February, 1812,
until February, 1815,—the government sold six per cent bonds at
various rates of discount, to the amount of fifty million dollars, and
this sum was the limit of its loans, except for a few bank discounts
of Treasury notes not exceeding a million in all. By forcing Treasury
notes on its creditors the Treasury obtained the use of twenty
millions more. After the peace it issued bonds and new Treasury notes,
which raised the aggregate amount of war debt, as far as could be
ascertained, to about eighty million five hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span> thousand dollars,
which was the war-addition to the old nominal capital of debt, and
increased the total indebtedness to one hundred and twenty-seven
millions at the close of the year 1815.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>The debt had exceeded eighty millions twenty years before, and in the
interval the country had greatly increased its resources. The war
debt was a trifling load, and would not have been felt except for the
confusion of the currency and the unnecessary taxation imposed at the
last moments of the war. That the currency and the war taxes were
severe trials was not to be denied, but of other trials the people had
little to complain.</p>

<p>Considering the dangers to which the United States were exposed, they
escaped with surprising impunity. The shores of Chesapeake Bay and
of Georgia were plundered; but the British government paid for the
slaves carried away, and no town of importance except Washington was
occupied by an enemy. Contrary to the usual experience of war, the
richest parts of the country suffered least. Only the Niagara frontier
was systematically ravaged. When the blockade of the coast was raised,
every seaboard city was able instantly to resume its commercial habits
without having greatly suffered from the interruption. The harvests
of two seasons were ready for immediate export, and the markets of
Europe were waiting to receive them. Every man found occupation, and
capital instantly returned to its old channels. From the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span> moment of
peace the exports of domestic produce began to exceed five million
dollars a month, while four millions was the highest average for any
previous twelvemonth, and the average for the seven years of embargo
and blockade since 1807 fell much short of two and a half millions. The
returns of commerce and navigation showed that during the seven months
from March 1 to October 1, 1815, domestic produce valued at forty-six
million dollars was exported, and American shipping to the amount of
eight hundred and fifty-four thousand tons was employed in the business
of export.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>The ease and rapidity of this revolution not only caused the war to
be quickly forgotten, but also silenced political passions. For the
first time in their history as a nation, the people of the United
States ceased to disturb themselves about politics or patronage. Every
political principle was still open to dispute, and was disputed; but
prosperity put an end to faction. No evidence could be given to prove
that the number or weight of persons who held the opinions commonly
known as Federalist, diminished either then or afterward. Massachusetts
showed no regret for the attitude she had taken. At the April election,
six weeks after the proclamation of peace, although Samuel Dexter was
the Republican candidate, the State still gave to Governor Strong
a majority of about seven thousand in a total vote of ninety-five
thousand. The Federalists reasonably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span> regarded this vote as an express
approval of the Hartford Convention and its proposed measures, and
asked what would have been their majority had peace not intervened
to save the Government from odium. They believed not only that their
popular support would have been greater, but that it would also have
shown a temper beyond control; yet the Federalist majority in April was
no longer hostile to the Government.</p>

<p>The other elections bore the same general character. Even in New
York the popular reaction seemed rather against the war than in its
favor. New York city in April returned Federalist members to the State
legislature, causing a tie in the Assembly, each party controlling
sixty-three votes.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> In Virginia the peace produced no change
so decided as to warrant a belief that the war had become popular.
In April John Randolph defeated Eppes and recovered control of his
district. The State which had chosen sixteen Republicans and seven
opposition congressmen in 1813, elected in 1815 seventeen Republicans
and six opposition members. The stability of parties was the more
remarkable in New York and Virginia, because those States were first to
feel the effects of renewed prosperity.</p>

<p>After the excitement of peace was past, as the summer drew toward a
close, economical interests dwarfed the old political distinctions and
gave a new character to parties. A flood of wealth poured into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span> the
Union at a steady rate of six or seven million dollars a month, and
the distribution of so large a sum could not fail to show interesting
results. The returns soon proved that the larger portion belonged to
the Southern States. Cotton, at a valuation of twenty cents a pound,
brought seventeen and a half millions to the planters; tobacco brought
eight and a quarter millions; rice produced nearly two million eight
hundred thousand dollars. Of fifty millions received from abroad in
payment for domestic produce within seven or eight months after the
peace, the slave States probably took nearly two thirds, though the
white population of the States south of the Potomac was less than half
the white population of the Union. The stimulus thus given to the slave
system was violent, and was most plainly shown in the cotton States,
where at least twenty million dollars were distributed in the year 1815
among a white population hardly exceeding half a million in all, while
the larger portion fell to the share of a few slave-owners.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Had the Northern States shared equally in the effects of this stimulus,
the situation would have remained relatively as before; but the
prosperity of the North was only moderate. The chief export of the
Northern States was wheat and Indian corn. Even of these staples,
Maryland and Virginia furnished a share; yet the total value of the
wheat and corn exported from the Union was but eight million<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span> three
hundred and fifty thousand dollars, while that of tobacco alone was
eight and a quarter millions. While flour sold at nine or ten dollars
a barrel, and Napoleon’s armies were vying with the Russians and
Austrians in creating an artificial demand, the Middle States made
a fair profit from their crops, although much less than was made by
the tobacco and cotton planters; but New England produced little for
export, and there the peace brought only ruin.</p>

<p>Ordinarily shipping was the source of New England’s profits. For
twenty-five years the wars in Europe had given to New England shipping
advantages which ceased with the return of peace. At first the change
of condition was not felt, for every ship was promptly employed; but
the reappearance of foreign vessels in American harbors showed that
competition must soon begin, and that the old rates of profit were at
an end.</p>

<p>Had this been all, Massachusetts could have borne it; but the shipping
on the whole suffered least among New England interests. The new
manufactures, in which large amounts of capital had been invested,
were ruined by the peace. If the United States poured domestic produce
valued at fifty million dollars into the markets of Great Britain,
Great Britain and her dependencies poured in return not less than forty
million dollars’ worth of imports into the United States, and inundated
the Union with manufactured goods which were sold at any sacrifice to
relieve the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span> British markets. Although the imported manufactures paid
duties of twenty-five per cent or more, they were sold at rates that
made American competition impossible.</p>

<p>The cotton manufacturers of Rhode Island, in a memorial to Congress,
dated October 20, 1815, declared that their one hundred and forty
manufactories, operating one hundred and thirty thousand spindles,
could no longer be worked with profit, and were threatened with speedy
destruction.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> New England could foresee with some degree of
certainty the ultimate loss of the great amount of capital invested in
these undertakings; but whether such fears for the future were just or
not, the loss of present profits was not a matter of speculation, but
of instant and evident notoriety. Before the close of the year 1815
little profit was left to the new industries. The cotton manufacture,
chiefly a New England interest, was supposed to employ a capital of
forty million dollars, and to expend about fifteen millions a year
in wages.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> The woollen manufacture, largely in Connecticut, was
believed to employ a capital of twelve million dollars.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Most of
the large factories for these staples were altogether stopped.</p>

<p>From every quarter the peace brought distress upon New England. During
the war most of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span> richer prizes had been sent to New England ports,
and the sale of their cargoes brought money and buyers into the
country; but this monopoly ceased at the same moment with the monopoly
of manufactures. The lumber trade was almost the last surviving
interest of considerable value, but in November Parliament imposed
duties on American lumber which nearly destroyed the New England trade.
The fisheries alone seemed to remain as a permanent resource.</p>

<p>The effect of these changes from prosperity to adversity was shown in
the usual forms. Emigration became active. Thousands of native New
Englanders transferred themselves to the valley of the Mohawk and
Western New York. All the cities of the coast had suffered a check from
the war; but while New York and Philadelphia began to recover their
lost ground, Boston was slow to feel the impulse. The financial reason
could be partly seen in the bank returns of Massachusetts. In January,
1814, the Massachusetts banks held about $7,300,000 in specie.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
In January and February, 1815, when peace was declared, the same
banks probably held still more specie, as the causes which led to the
influx were not removed. In June, about three months later, they held
only $3,464,000 in specie, and the drain steadily continued, until
in June, 1816, the specie in their vaults was reduced to $1,260,000,
while their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span> discounts were not increased and their circulation was
diminished.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>The state of the currency and the policy pursued by the Treasury added
to the burden carried by New England. There alone the banks maintained
specie payments. In the autumn of 1815, while the notes of the Boston
banks were equivalent to gold, Treasury notes were at eleven per cent
discount in Boston; New York bank-notes were at eleven and a half per
cent discount; Philadelphia at sixteen; Baltimore at seventeen and
eighteen; and United States six-percent bonds sold at eighty-six. In
New England the Government exacted payments either in Treasury notes or
in the notes of local banks equivalent to specie. Elsewhere it accepted
the notes of local banks at a rate of depreciation much greater than
that of Treasury notes. This injustice in exacting taxes was doubled by
an equivalent injustice in paying debts. In New England the Treasury
compelled creditors to take payment in whatever medium it had at hand,
or to go unpaid. Elsewhere the Treasury paid its debts in the currency
it received for its taxes.</p>

<p>Dallas admitted the wrong, but made no serious attempt to correct it.
So complicated was the currency that the Treasury was obliged to keep
four accounts with each of its ninety-four banks of deposit,—(1) in
the currency of the bank itself; (2) in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span> special deposits of other bank
currency; (3) in special deposits of Treasury notes bearing interest;
(4) in small Treasury notes not bearing interest. In New England,
and also in the cities of New York and Philadelphia, for some months
after the peace the taxes were paid in Treasury notes. So little local
currency was collected at these chief centres of business that the
Treasury did not attempt to discharge its warrants there in currency.
As the Treasury notes gradually appreciated in value above the local
bank-notes of the Middle States, tax-payers ceased to make payments
in them, and paid in their local bank-notes. Little by little the
accumulation of local currency in the Treasury deposits at Philadelphia
and New York increased, until the Treasury was able to draw on them in
payment of its warrants; but even at those points this degree of credit
was not attained in 1815, and in New England the Treasury still made
no payments except in Treasury notes, or the notes of distant banks at
a discount still greater than that of Treasury notes. This exceptional
severity toward New England was admitted by Dallas, and excused only
for the reason that if he were just to New England he must be severe to
the rest of the country. Every holder of a Treasury warrant would have
demanded payment at the place where the local medium was of the highest
value, which was Boston; and as the Treasury could not pay specie at
Boston without exacting specie elsewhere, Dallas paid no attention to
Constitutional scruples or legal objections,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span> but arbitrarily excluded
Boston from the number of points where warrants were paid in local
currency.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>The people of Boston criticised, with much severity and with apparent
justice, Dallas’s management of the finances, which seemed to require
some explanation not furnished in his reports. By an Act approved March
3, Congress authorized a loan of $18,452,800 to absorb the outstanding
Treasury notes. At that time, under the momentary reaction of peace
excitement, Treasury notes were supposed to be worth about ninety-four
cents in the dollar, and Dallas expected to convert them nearly dollar
for dollar into six-per-cent bonds. His proposals were issued March 10,
inviting bids for twelve millions, and requiring only “that the terms
of the proposals should bear some relation to the actual fair price of
stock in the market of Philadelphia or New York.” When the bids were
received, Dallas rejected them all, because in his opinion they were
below the market rates. “In point of fact,” he afterward said, “no
direct offer was made to subscribe at a higher rate than eighty-nine
per cent, while some of the offers were made at a rate even lower
than seventy-five per cent.” Although the old six-per-cents were then
selling at eighty-nine, eighty-eight, and eighty-seven in Boston and
New York, Dallas held that “the real condition of the public credit”
required him to insist upon ninety-five as the value of the new stock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span></p>

<p>After failing to obtain ninety-five or even ninety as the price of his
bonds, Dallas resorted to expedients best described in his own words.
As he could not fund the Treasury notes at the rate he wished, he
abandoned the attempt, and used the loan only to supply the local wants
of the Treasury:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The objects of the loan being to absorb a portion of the
Treasury-note debt, and to acquire a sufficiency of local
currency for local purposes, the price of the stock at the
Treasury was of course independent of the daily up-and-down
prices of the various stock markets in the Union, and could
only be affected by the progress toward the attainment of
those objects. Thus while the wants of the Treasury were
insufficiently supplied, offers to subscribe were freely
accepted, and the parties were sometimes authorized and invited
to increase the amount of their offers; but where the local
funds had so accumulated as to approach the probable amount of
the local demands, the price of the stock was raised at the
Treasury, and when the accumulation was deemed adequate to the
whole amount of the local demands the loan was closed.”<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Governments which insisted upon borrowing at rates higher than the
money market allowed, could do so only by helping to debase the
currency. Dallas’s course offered encouragement to the suspended
banks alone. The schedule of his loans proved that he paid a premium
to insolvency. Of all places where he most needed “a sufficiency
of local currency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span> for local purposes,” Boston stood first; but he
borrowed in Boston less than one hundred thousand dollars, and this
only in Treasury notes. Next to Boston stood New York; but in New York
Dallas borrowed only $658,000, also in Treasury notes. In Philadelphia
he obtained more than three millions, and took $1,845,000 in the
depreciated local currency. In Baltimore he took nearly two millions
in local currency; and in the bank paper of the District of Columbia,
which was the most depreciated of all, he accepted $2,282,000 in local
currency.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Thus the loan which he had asked Congress to authorize
for the purpose of absorbing the excess of Treasury notes, brought into
the Treasury only about three millions in these securities, while it
relieved the banks of Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington of six
millions of their depreciated paper, worth about eighty cents in the
dollar, and provided nothing to redeem the government’s overdue bills
at Boston and New York.</p>

<p>Had Dallas pursued a different course and funded all the overdue
Treasury notes at the market rate, he might not have relieved New
England, but he would have placed the government in a position to deal
effectually with the suspended banks elsewhere. The immediate result
of his refusal to redeem the dishonored Treasury notes was to depress
their market value, and to discredit the government. Treasury notes
fell to eighty-eight and eighty-seven, while the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span> six-per-cents fell as
low as eighty-one. In Washington, Baltimore, and Philadelphia Dallas
obtained enough local currency to meet local obligations, and doubtless
saved to the government a small percentage by thus trafficking in its
own discredit; but in gaining this advantage he offered encouragement
to the over-issues of the suspended banks, and he helped to embarrass
the solvent banks in the chief commercial centres as well as those in
New England.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>At the close of the year 1815 the general effect of the peace was
already well defined. The Southern States were in the full enjoyment of
extraordinary prosperity. The Middle States were also prosperous and
actively engaged in opening new sources of wealth. Only the Eastern
States suffered under depression; but there it was so severe as to
warrant a doubt whether New England could recover from the shock.
The new epoch of American history began by the sudden decline of
Massachusetts to the lowest point of relative prosperity and influence
she had ever known, and by an equally sudden stimulus to the South and
West. So discredited was Massachusetts that she scarcely ventured to
complain, for every complaint uttered by her press was answered by the
ironical advice that she should call another Hartford Convention.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Between</span> 1801 and 1815, great changes in the American people
struck the most superficial observer. The Rights of Man occupied public
thoughts less, and the price of cotton more, in the later than in the
earlier time. Although in 1815 Europe was suffering under a violent
reaction against free government, Americans showed little interest
and no alarm, compared with their emotions of twenty years before.
Napoleon resumed his empire, and was overthrown at Waterloo, without
causing the people of the United States to express a sign of concern
in his fate; and France was occupied by foreign armies without rousing
among Americans a fear of England. Foreign affairs seemed reduced to
the question whether England would consent to negotiate a treaty of
commerce.</p>

<p>After excluding most of the American demands, Lord Castlereagh
consented to a commercial convention abolishing discriminating duties,
and admitting American commerce with the East Indies. This treaty,
signed July 3, seemed to satisfy American demands, and the British
Ministry showed no wish to challenge new disputes. With France, the
disturbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span> condition of government permitted no diplomatic arrangement.
The only foreign country that required serious attention was Algiers;
and Decatur, with a strong squadron of the new American cruisers,
speedily compelled the Dey to sign a treaty more favorable to the
United States than he had yet signed with any other nation. Tunis and
Tripoli showed a similar disposition, and Decatur returned home in the
autumn, having settled to his satisfaction all the matters intrusted to
his care.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances, without an anxiety in regard to foreign or
domestic affairs, President Madison sent his Annual Message to Congress
December 5, 1815. It told a pleasant story of successful administration
and of rapidly growing income; but its chief historical interest
lay in the lines of future party politics that Madison more or less
unconsciously sketched. The Message proved, or seemed to prove, that
Madison’s views and wishes lay in the direction of strong government.
He advised “liberal provision” for defence; more military academies;
an improved and enlarged navy; effectual protection to manufactures;
new national roads and canals; a national university; and such an
organization of the militia as would place it promptly and effectually
under control of the national government. Madison seemed to take his
stand, beyond further possibility of change, on the system of President
Washington.</p>

<p>Dallas’s report echoed the tone of Alexander Hamilton.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span> Very long,
chiefly historical, and interesting beyond the common, this Treasury
Report of 1815 recommended a scale of annual expenditure exceeding
twenty-seven millions, in place of the old scale of ten millions. The
expenditure was to be but a part of the system. A protective tariff of
customs duties was assumed to be intended by Congress, and a national
bank was urged as the only efficient means by which the government
could recover control over the currency.</p>

<p>Although the President was less emphatic than the secretary in holding
a national bank to be the only cure for the disorders of the currency,
he was prepared to go a step further by issuing government paper as a
national currency, and suggested that alternative in his Message. A
national bank or a national currency was an equally energetic exercise
of supreme central powers not expressly granted by the Constitution and
much disputed by theorists. Dallas’s objection to the national currency
did not relate to its inefficiency, but to the practical difficulty of
issuing paper and keeping it in issue. Either course of action implied
a recurrence to the principles of President Washington. The Executive
proposed to start afresh in 1816 from its point of departure in 1790.</p>

<p>The Fourteenth Congress was well disposed to support the attempt. Under
the stress of war the people had selected as their representatives the
ablest and most vigorous men of their generation. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span> war leaders were
mostly returned,—Calhoun, Clay, Lowndes, Richard M. Johnson, Peter
B. Porter, and John Forsyth,—while the old peace party was strongly
represented by Timothy Pickering, Daniel Webster, John Randolph,
Grosvenor of New York, and Stanford of North Carolina; but perhaps the
most distinguished member of all was William Pinkney of Maryland. A
swarm of younger men, far above the average, reinforced both sides of
the House. Philip P. Barbour sat again for Virginia. John McLean sat
again for Ohio. Henry St. George Tucker came for the first time into
the House. Joseph Hopkinson, Samuel D. Ingham, and John Sergeant raised
the character of the Pennsylvania delegation; and Samuel Smith, at
last ejected from the Senate by a Federalist legislature in Maryland,
reappeared in the House for the first time since 1803.</p>

<p>The Senate was also improved. The disappearance of Leib and Samuel
Smith was made more suggestive by the resignation of Giles. David Stone
of North Carolina, another independent much given to opposition at
critical moments, also resigned; and another of the same class, Joseph
Anderson of Tennessee, who had been a member of the Senate since 1797,
retired to become First Comptroller of the Treasury. These retirements
removed the chief abettors of faction, and changed the character of
the Senate until it seemed to belong to a different epoch. Jonathan
Roberts still sat in the place of Leib. Armistead Mason took the seat
of Giles, and with James Barbour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span> gave Madison for the first time the
full support of Virginia. Macon took the place of David Stone. George
W. Campbell took the place of Joseph Anderson. Robert G. Harper, the
old champion of Federalism, succeeded Samuel Smith from Maryland. The
Senate scarcely recognized itself as the same body that since 1808 had
so persistently thwarted and fretted the President.</p>

<p>In the arrangement of new party divisions the Fourteenth Congress,
unlike its recent predecessors, consciously aimed to take a decided
share. The House seemed for the first time in many years to pride
itself on intellectual superiority. William Pinkney, Calhoun, Lowndes,
Clay, Daniel Webster, John Randolph, and their associates were not men
who bowed to authority, even of the people, but rather looked on the
task of government as a function of superior intellect. They proposed
to correct what they considered mistaken popular tendencies. Each
expressed his ideas with sufficient clearness in the form natural to
him. Calhoun generalized before descending to particulars.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the policy of nations,” reasoned Calhoun, “there are two
extremes: one extreme, in which justice and moderation may sink
in feebleness; another, in which that lofty spirit which ought
to animate all nations, particularly free ones, may mount up to
military violence. These extremes ought to be equally avoided;
but of the two, I consider the first far the most dangerous....
I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span> consider the extreme of weakness not only the most dangerous
of itself, but as that extreme to which the people of this
country are peculiarly liable.”</p>
</div>

<p>Clay, aiming at the same objects, dwelt chiefly on foreign dangers as
the motive of the strong government he wished to establish. “That man
must be blind to the indications of the future,” he declared,<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
“who cannot see that we are destined to have war after war with
Great Britain, until, if one of the two nations be not crushed, all
grounds of collision shall have ceased between us.” He wished to
create a government that should control the destinies of both American
continents by a display of armed force. “He confessed with infinite
regret that he saw a supineness throughout the country which left him
almost without hope that what he believed the correct policy would
be pursued,” toward aiding the Spanish colonies against their mother
country. Both Calhoun and Clay admitted that they wished to govern in
a sense not approved by an apparent majority of the nation; and the
sympathies of the House were openly or secretly with them.</p>

<p>Of the contrary sentiment, John Randolph was the champion. Although
his early career had ended in the most conspicuous failure yet known
in American politics, he returned to the House, with intelligence
morbidly sharpened, to begin a second epoch of his life with powers and
materials that gave him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span> the position of equal among men like Calhoun,
Pinkney, and Webster. Randolph held a decisive advantage in wishing
only to obstruct. He had no legislation to propose, and his political
philosophy suited that extreme “to which,” according to Calhoun, “the
people of this country are peculiarly liable.” Early in the session
Randolph showed that he understood even better than Calhoun and Clay
the division between himself and them. “If the warning voice of Patrick
Henry,” he said in the debate of January 31, 1816,<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> “had not
apprised me long ago, the events of this day would have taught me that
this Constitution does not comprise one people, but that there are two
distinct characters in the people of this nation.” In every growing
people two or more distinct characters were likely to rise, else the
people would not grow; but the primal character, which Randolph meant
to represent, enjoyed the political advantage of passive resistance to
impulse from every direction.</p>

<p>In reply to Calhoun, Randolph defined the issue with his usual skill of
words:<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As the gentleman from South Carolina has presented the question
to the House, they and the nation cannot have the slightest
difficulty in deciding whether they will give up the States or
not; whether they will, in fact, make this an elective monarchy.
The question is whether or not we are willing to become one
great consolidated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span> nation; or whether we have still respect
enough for those old, respectable institutions to regard their
integrity and preservation as a part of our policy.”</p>
</div>

<p>Randolph’s eccentricities, which amounted to insanity, prevented him
from exercising in the House the influence to which his experience and
abilities entitled him, but did not prevent him from reflecting the
opinions of a large part of the nation, particularly in the South.
Between these two impulses the Fourteenth Congress was to choose a
path, subject to the future judgment of their constituents.</p>

<p>The Executive urged them on. Dallas began by sending to Calhoun, the
chairman of the Committee on Currency, a plan for a national bank with
a capital of thirty-five millions and power to increase it to fifty
millions; with twenty-five directors, five of whom were to be appointed
by the government to represent its share in the bank stock, of which
the government was to subscribe one fifth.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>In another report, dated Feb. 12, 1816, Dallas recommended a protective
tariff and sketched its details. Upon cotton fabrics he proposed a duty
of thirty-three and one half per cent on their value; on woollens,
twenty-eight per cent; on linen, hemp, and silk, twenty per cent; on
paper, leather, etc., thirty-five per cent; on earthenware, glassware,
etc., thirty per cent; on bar-iron, seventy-five cents per hundred
weight; on rolled iron, a dollar and a half; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span> on unenumerated
articles, fifteen per cent. These duties were avowedly protective,
intended to serve as the foundation of a system, and to perpetuate the
policy to which the Government stood pledged by its legislation for the
last six years. In connection with a proposed reduction of internal
taxes, the Bank and the Tariff covered the financial field.</p>

<p>The House first grappled with the subject of revenue. The Committee
of Ways and Means, through William Lowndes, reported, Jan. 9, 1816, a
scheme embodied in twelve Resolutions intended to serve as the guide
to definite legislation. Lowndes assumed a net annual revenue of
$25,369,000; and to obtain this sum he proposed to shift the burden of
about seven million dollars from internal taxation to the customs, by
an addition of forty-two per cent to the rates of permanent duty.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
The direct tax was to be retained to the amount of three million
dollars, and an annual fund of $13,500,000 was to be set aside for the
interest and principal of the national debt.</p>

<p>Hardly had the debate begun when Randolph, January 16, dragged
the question of a protective system into the prominence it was
thenceforward to maintain. Two years of repose had singularly improved
his skill in the choice of language and in the instigation of class
against class.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The manufacturer,” said he,<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> “is the citizen of no place
or any place; the agriculturist has his property, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span> lands,
his all, his household Gods to defend,—and like that meek
drudge the ox, who does the labor and ploughs the ground, then
for his reward takes the refuse of the farm-yard, the blighted
blades and the mouldy straw, and the mildewed shocks of corn
for his support.... Alert, vigilant, enterprising, and active,
the manufacturing interest are collected in masses, and ready
to associate at a moment’s warning for any purpose of general
interest to their body. Do but ring the fire-bell, and you can
assemble all the manufacturing interest of Philadelphia in
fifteen minutes. Nay, for the matter of that they are always
assembled; they are always on the Rialto, and Shylock and
Antonio meet there every day as friends, and compare notes, and
possess in trick and intelligence what, in the goodness of God
to them, the others can never possess.”</p>
</div>

<p>Randolph’s political sagacity was nowhere better shown than in
replying, Jan. 31, 1816, to a speech of Calhoun: “On whom do your
impost duties bear?” he asked.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> “Upon whom bears the duty on coarse
woollens and linens and blankets, upon salt, and all the necessaries of
life? On poor men, and on slaveholders.” With a perception abnormally
keen, Randolph fixed on the tariff and the slaveholders as the
necessary combination to oppose the nationalizing efforts of Calhoun
and Clay.</p>

<p>No leader of note supported Randolph. He stood alone, or with only the
support of Stanford, as far as concerned debate; but he led nearly
half the House. Upon Benjamin Hardin’s motion, February 3, to repeal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
the direct tax immediately and altogether, a motion which struck at
the root of Dallas’s scheme, the House decided by eighty-one votes
against seventy-three to sustain the secretary. On the passage of the
bill to continue the direct tax of three million dollars for one year,
the minority lacked but a change of three votes to defeat it. The bill
passed, March 4, by a vote of sixty-seven to sixty-three.</p>

<p>On the tariff the House was more closely divided. The Committee of
Ways and Means consisted of seven members. Lowndes was chairman. Three
other members were from the South, one of whom, Robertson of Louisiana,
wished protection for sugar. Three members were from the North, one of
whom, Ingham of Pennsylvania, represented Dallas’s views. The chief
question concerned the duty on cottons and woollens. So close was
the division that Ingham, to use his own words, was struck dumb with
astonishment when the committee, after adopting a duty of fifty-six per
cent for the protection of sugar, voted to impose a duty of only twenty
per cent on cottons and woollens. “It was, however, too glaringly
inconsistent and palpably wrong to be persisted in, and therefore
it was that the Committee of Ways and Means, upon reconsideration,
substituted the twenty-five per cent which was reported in the
bill.”<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>When the bill came before the House, Clay moved, March 21, to
substitute the rate of thirty-three and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span> one third per cent for that of
twenty-five per cent on cottons, for the express purpose of testing the
sense of the House. Clay and the Northern protectionists held that the
committee’s bill did not afford protection enough. The committee, also
admitting the propriety of protection, maintained that twenty-five per
cent was sufficient. On both sides some temper was shown, and charges
of sectionalism were made. By a vote of sixty-eight to sixty-one, the
House in committee voted, March 22, to impose a duty of thirty per
cent. Daniel Webster then moved to limit this rate to two years, after
which the duty should be twenty-five per cent for two years more, when
it should be reduced to twenty per cent. Finally the House adopted a
duty of twenty-five per cent for three years. Webster also carried,
March 27, a motion to reduce the proposed duty on bar-iron from
seventy-five to forty-five cents a hundred weight.</p>

<p>All the members of note, except Randolph, professed to favor
protection. Calhoun was as decided as Ingham. “He believed the
policy of the country required protection to our manufacturing
establishments.”<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> The bill was assumed to offer protection enough,
and the House disputed only whether the adopted duties were or were not
sufficient. The actual free-trade sentiment was shown, April 8, when
Randolph made a final motion to postpone, and was beaten by a vote of
ninety-five to forty-seven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span></p>

<p>The bill promptly passed the Senate, and was approved by the President
April 27; but the true issue was undecided. No one could deny that
if the duty of twenty-five per cent on cottons and woollens should
prove to be insufficient, the House was pledged to increase it. The
bill was avowedly protective. In regard to the coarser Indian cottons,
it was practically prohibitive, since it valued them all, for tariff
purposes, at twenty-five cents a yard,—a rate which on the cheaper
fabrics raised the duty above one hundred per cent. Yet when the tariff
of 1816 proved to be little protective, in after years it was commonly
represented as a revenue and not a protective tariff. In substance,
Randolph’s opinions controlled the House.</p>

<p>Dallas was more fortunate in regard to the Bank. Randolph’s hostility
to State banks was greater than to the Bank of the United States.
Calhoun reported, January 8, the bill to incorporate for twenty years
a new National Bank with a capital of thirty-five million dollars,
and supported it, February 26, by a speech showing that the Bank was
a proper means for attaining the Constitutional object of restoring
the money of the country to its true medium. Active opposition came
chiefly from the Federalists. Even Samuel Smith seemed to plead rather
that the State banks should be gently treated than that the National
Bank should be opposed. Randolph, while professing hostility to the new
Bank on any and every ground suggested by others, concluded by pledging
himself to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span> support any adequate means for reducing the overpowering
influence of the State banks. Clay thought himself obliged to leave the
Speaker’s chair in order to recant in the most public manner his errors
of 1811. Forsyth, one of Calhoun’s ablest allies, went so far in his
support of the measure as to assert without reserve that the power to
suspend specie payments—a power expressly reserved to the government
by Calhoun’s bill—belonged undoubtedly to Congress, an opinion which
the House did not share. In the Republican ranks open opposition to
the Bank seemed almost silenced; and the member who made himself most
conspicuous in hostility to the bill was Daniel Webster,—the last of
all in whom such a course was natural.</p>

<p>Webster’s criticism on Calhoun’s Constitutional argument was made in
his loftiest manner. The currency, he said, needed no reform, for it
was, by the Constitution and the law, gold and silver; nor had Congress
the right to make any other medium current. The true remedy was for
Congress to interdict the bills of the suspended banks.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Had he
been content to rest his opposition on that ground alone, Webster could
not have been answered, although he might have been regarded as an
impracticable politician; but as the bill came toward its passage, and
as several Federalists declared in its favor, he pressed his hostility
so far, and with so much dogmatism, that several of his own party
revolted, and Grosvenor of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span> New York replied sharply that he did not
propose to be drilled to vote on whatever any one might choose to call
a principle.</p>

<p>In spite of determined opposition from Webster, Pitkin, John Sergeant,
and other Federalists, the House passed the bill, March 14, by a vote
of eighty to seventy-one. The majority was small, but of the minority
not less than thirty-eight were Federalists; and, omitting Randolph
and Stanford, only thirty-one Republicans voted against the bill. The
House contained one hundred and seventeen Republicans. In the Senate
the opposition was almost wholly confined to Federalists, and the bill
passed by a majority much larger than that in the House. Twenty-two
senators voted in its favor; only twelve voted against it, and of the
twelve only four were Republicans. The President approved it April 10;
and thus, after five years of financial disorder, the Republican party
reverted to the system of Washington, and resumed powers it had found
indispensable to government.</p>

<p>The Federalists of New England were in a situation too alarming to
bear even the little delay required to organize the Bank. For them a
general return to specie payments was the only escape from imminent
ruin; and acting on this conviction, Webster moved, April 26, a joint
Resolution ordering that all taxes should be collected after Feb. 1,
1817, in some medium equivalent to specie, thus allowing but nine
months for the work of resumption. The same day the House passed the
Resolution by the decisive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span> majority of seventy-one to thirty-four. The
Senate substituted February 20 as the day of resumption, and passed the
Resolution April 29, which was approved by the President the next day.</p>

<p>In contrast with the imbecility of many previous Congresses, the vigor
of the Fourteenth Congress in thus settling the new scale of government
was remarkable; but other measures of importance were not wanting. An
Act approved April 29 appropriated one million dollars annually for
three years to build ships of war; an Act approved April 19 authorized
the people of Indiana to form a State government. A bill, which passed
the House but was postponed by the Senate and became law at the next
session, provided for the admission of Mississippi. In still another
direction the House showed its self-confidence in a manner that caused
unusual popular excitement. It undertook to increase the pay of its own
members and of senators.</p>

<p>The scale of salary for public officials was low. The President,
relatively highly paid, received twenty-five thousand dollars. The
Secretaries of State and Treasury received five thousand; those of
War and Navy, four thousand; the Attorney-General, three thousand;
Chief-Justice Marshall was paid four thousand, and the six associate
justices received thirty-five hundred dollars each.</p>

<p>While the Executive and Judiciary were paid regular salaries, Congress
stood on a different footing. Legislators had never been paid what
was considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span> an equivalent for their time and services. They were
supposed to be unpaid; but such a rule excluded poor men from the
public service, and therefore the colonial legislatures adopted a
practice, which Congress continued, of allowing what were supposed
to be the reasonable expenses of members. The First Congress fixed
upon six dollars a day, and six dollars for every twenty miles of
estimated journey, as a suitable scale of expense both for senators
and representatives;<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> and the same rate had been continued
for twenty-five years. No one supposed it sufficient to support a
household, but poor men could live upon it. Desha of Kentucky averred
that it was a fair allowance for the average representative. According
to him, board was twelve or thirteen dollars a week, and the total cost
of a session of one hundred and fifty days amounted to five hundred
and seventy or eighty dollars; so that the western and southwestern
members, with whose habits he was familiar, carried home, with their
mileage, about four hundred and fifty dollars in savings.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>In the pride of conscious superiority the Fourteenth Congress undertook
to change the system; and Richard M. Johnson, probably the most popular
member of the House, assumed the risk of popular displeasure. In moving
for a committee, March 4, Johnson repudiated the idea of increasing
the pay; and his committee, including Webster, Pitkin, Jackson, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
President’s brother-in-law, Grosvenor, and McLean of Ohio, reported
through him that fifteen hundred dollars a year was the correct
equivalent of six dollars a day.</p>

<p>The bill known as the Compensation Bill was reported March 6, and
was debated for two days with some animation. Among its supporters
John Randolph was prominent, and gave offence to the opponents of the
measure by his usual tactics. Most of the friends of the bill stoutly
insisted that it did not increase the pay; most of its opponents
averred that it more than doubled the amount. Calhoun admitted the
increase of pay, and favored it, in order to retain “young men of
genius without property” in the public service. The bill was hurried
through the House.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Compensation Bill,” said Forsyth at the next session,<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
“was the only one of any interest pushed through the Committee
of the whole House and ordered to a third reading in a single
day. All motions to amend were rejected; for the committee to
rise and report progress and ask leave to sit again, met with
a similar fate.... The House refused repeated propositions to
adjourn, and continued its sittings until the bill was ordered
to be engrossed.”</p>
</div>

<p>No time was lost. Johnson moved for a committee March 4; the committee
reported the bill March 6; the House in committee took it up March 7,
and reported it the same day. The House passed it March<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span> 8, by a vote
of eighty-one to sixty-seven. In the Senate the bill was read for a
second time March 12. In the course of the debate one of the New Jersey
senators, commenting on the haste shown by the House to pass the bill,
added that also “in the Senate postponement, commitment, and amendment
are all refused, and it is to be pushed through by main strength with a
haste altogether unusual.” The Senate passed it March 14, by a vote of
twenty-one to eleven; and it received the President’s signature March
19, barely a fortnight after Johnson’s request for a committee.</p>

<p>At the time when the bill was still under consideration by the
President, and the House had just passed the Bank Act, the Republican
members of both Houses met to nominate a candidate to succeed Madison
as President. Three candidates were in the field,—Daniel D. Tompkins,
William H. Crawford, and James Monroe.</p>

<p>The choice was a matter of small consequence, for any candidate of the
Republican party was sure of almost unanimous election, and all were
respectable men; but Tompkins could expect little support at a time
when Congress selected the candidate, for only men well known in the
national service were likely to satisfy the standard of Congressmen.
The true contest lay between Crawford and Monroe, and was complicated,
as far as the candidates themselves understood it, by personal
intrigues on both sides. Perhaps Crawford’s strength was the greater,
for four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span> fifths of the New York members favored him rather than
the Virginian.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> In cases where no strong feeling fixed results,
dexterity in management might overcome a preference between persons;
and by some means never explained, the preference of the New York
members for Crawford was overcome. One of these members—a competent
observer—believed that Martin Van Buren and Peter B. Porter, for
reasons of their own, prevented New York from declaring for Crawford
when such a declaration would have decided the result.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Crawford
himself at the last professed to withdraw from the contest,<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> and
several of his warm friends did not attend the caucus. On the evening
of March 15, one hundred and nineteen senators and representatives
appeared in the hall of the House of Representatives in obedience to an
anonymous notice addressed to one hundred and forty-three Republican
members. Sixty-five, or less than half the Republican representation,
voted for Monroe; fifty-four voted for Crawford; and eighty-five then
united in nominating Governor Tompkins as Vice-President.</p>

<p>Monroe’s character was well known, and his elevation to the Presidency
was a result neither of great popularity nor of exceptional force,
but was rather due to the sudden peace which left him the residuum of
Madison’s many Cabinets. A long list of resignations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span> alone remained
to recall the memory of his associates. Robert Smith, Cæsar Rodney,
William Eustis, Paul Hamilton, Gallatin, G. W. Campbell, William Jones,
William Pinkney, and John Armstrong had all resigned in succession,
leaving Monroe and Dallas in possession of the government when peace
was declared. Dallas was not a popular character, whatever were his
abilities or services; and no other man occupied high ground. Under
such circumstances the strength shown by Crawford was surprising, and
proved that Monroe, notwithstanding his advantages, was regarded with
no exclusive favor.</p>

<p>In truth Monroe had no party. His original friends were the old
Republicans,—John Taylor of Caroline, Littleton Tazewell, John
Randolph, and their associates, from whom he had drawn apart. His new
friends were chiefly northern Democrats, whose motives for preferring
him to Crawford were selfish. In any case an epoch of personal politics
could be foreseen, for men like Crawford, Calhoun, and Clay never
submitted long to a superior; and for such an epoch Monroe was probably
the best choice.</p>

<p>Shortly after the nomination Dallas gave notice to the President that
he meant to retire from the Treasury in order to resume his practice
at the bar.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Madison immediately wrote to Gallatin, April 12,
inviting him to resume charge of the Treasury; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span> Gallatin was weary
of domestic politics, and preferred diplomacy. He went as minister to
France, while Dallas remained at the Treasury until October, to set the
new Bank in motion.</p>

<p>These arrangements closed the first session of the Fourteenth Congress,
which adjourned April 30, leaving Madison in unaccustomed peace,
harassed by no more enemies or dissensions, to wait the close of his
public life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> prosperity that followed the Peace of Ghent suffered no
check during the year 1816, or during the remainder of Madison’s term.
The exports of domestic produce, officially valued at $45,000,000 for
the year ending Sept. 30, 1815, were valued at nearly $65,000,000 for
the following year, and exceeded $68,000,000 for 1817. The Southern
States still supplied two thirds of the exported produce. Cotton to the
amount of $24,000,000, tobacco valued at nearly $13,000,000, and rice
at $3,500,000, contributed more than forty of the sixty-five millions
of domestic exports in 1816. The tables<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> showed that while South
Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana gained with unparalleled rapidity, New
England lost ground, and New York only maintained its uniform movement.
While the domestic exports of Georgia and Louisiana trebled in value,
those of New York increased from eight to fourteen millions.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the great importations from Europe which under ordinary
conditions would have counterbalanced the exports, the exchanges soon
turned in favor of the United States. Before the close of 1816<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
specie in considerable quantities began to flow into the country.
Canada, being nearest, felt the drain first, and suffered much
inconvenience from it; but during the summer of 1816 and 1817 Europe
also shipped much specie to America. Every ship brought some amount,
until the export began to affect the Bank of England, which at last
found its bullion diminishing with alarming rapidity. The returns
showed a drain beginning in July or August, 1817, when the Bank of
England held £11,668,000, until August, 1819, when the supply was
reduced to £3,595,000; and in the interval a commercial crisis, with a
general destruction of credit, occurred. The reaction could not fail in
the end to affect America as it affected England, but the first result
was stimulating beyond all previous experience. In England the drain
of specie embarrassed government in returning to specie payments. In
the United States the influx of specie made the return easy, if not
necessary.</p>

<p>The recovery of internal exchanges kept pace with the influx of specie.
At Boston, July 27, 1816, United States six-per-cent bonds were quoted
at eighty-five, and Treasury notes at ninety-four to ninety-four and
one-half; at New York six-per-cents stood at ninety, and Treasury
notes at par; in Philadelphia six-per-cents were worth ninety-eight,
and Treasury notes one hundred and seven; in Baltimore six-per-cents
were selling at one hundred and two, and Treasury notes at one hundred
and twelve.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span> During the next five months the recovery was steady
and rapid. The banks of New York, September 26, began to cash their
one-dollar notes, thus relieving the community from the annoyance of
fractional currency. October 26 the six-per-cents stood at ninety-two
in Boston, at ninety-three and one-half in New York, at ninety-eight
in Philadelphia, and at one hundred and one and one-half in Baltimore.
November 28 they sold at ninety-six in Boston; November 30 they sold
at ninety-six and one-quarter in New York, at one hundred and one and
one-half in Philadelphia, and at one hundred and five in Baltimore.
January 1, 1817, the Treasury resumed payments at Boston in Boston
money, and no further discredit attached to government securities.</p>

<p>The banks of the Middle States were less disposed than the government
to hasten the return of specie payments. In order to do so, they were
obliged to contract their circulation and discounts to an extent that
would have been unendurable in any time but one of great prosperity;
and only the threats of Dallas overcame their reluctance, even under
most favorable conditions. Both Dallas and the President were irritated
by their slowness.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> July 22, 1816, the Secretary of the Treasury
issued a circular warning them that, at whatever cost, the Treasury
must carry into effect the order of Congress to collect the revenue,
after Feb. 20, 1817, only in specie or its equivalent. “The banks in
the States to the South,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span> said,<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> “and to the west of Maryland,
are ready and willing, it is believed, to co-operate in the same
measure. The objection, or the obstacle to the measure, principally
rests with the banks of the Middle States.” Dallas invited them to
assist the Treasury in resuming specie payments with the least possible
delay; and accordingly the banks of the Middle States held a convention
at Philadelphia, August 6, to consider their course.</p>

<p>This convention, on discussing the possibility of resumption, agreed
that the banks needed more time than the government was disposed to
allow. Credit had been necessarily expanded by the unusual scale of
commerce and enterprise. So sudden and violent a contraction as was
required for specie payments could not fail to distress the public, and
might cause great suffering. Yet in some degree the new United States
Bank could relieve this pressure; and therefore the resumption should
not be attempted by the State banks until the National Bank should be
fairly opened and ready to begin its discounts. The State banks in
convention foresaw, or imagined, that the United States Bank could
not begin operations so early as Feb. 20, 1817, and they declined to
risk resumption without its aid. Acting on this impression, they met
Dallas’s urgency by a formal recommendation that their banks should
begin to pay specie, not on the 20th of February, but on the first
Monday of July, 1817.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span></p>

<p>This decision, though unsatisfactory to Dallas and the President, could
not be considered unreasonable. Credit was expanded beyond the limit of
safety, and the government was largely responsible for the expansion.
Many of the State banks were probably unsound from the first, and
needed careful management. Between 1810 and 1830, on a total capital of
one hundred and forty millions, the bank failures amounted to thirty
millions, or more than one fifth of the whole.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> In Pennsylvania the
country banks reduced their issues from $4,756,000 in November, 1816,
to $1,318,000 in November, 1819. The latter moment was one of extreme
depression, but the former was probably not that of the greatest
expansion. When the banks of the Middle States held their convention,
Aug. 6, 1816, contraction had already begun, and steadily continued,
while specie flowed into the country to supply a foundation for bank
paper. Under such circumstances the banks asked no extravagant favor in
recommending that eleven months, instead of seven, should be allowed
for resumption.</p>

<p>Dallas was not disposed to concede this favor. Having at last the
necessary machinery for controlling the State banks, he used it with
the same vigor that marked all his acts. No sooner had the convention
announced its unwillingness to co-operate with the Treasury in
executing the order of Congress, than Dallas issued instructions,
August 16,<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span> hastening the preparations for opening the National
Bank as early as Jan. 1, 1817. Soon afterward, September 12, he renewed
his notice that the notes of suspended banks would be rejected by the
Treasury after Feb. 20, 1817.</p>

<p>The Bank subscription was filled in August, a deficit of three million
dollars being taken by Stephen Girard in a single mass.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> In October
the board of directors was chosen by the shareholders, and in November
the directors met and elected as President the former Secretary of the
Navy, William Jones. One of their first acts was much debated, and was
strongly opposed in the board of directors by J. J. Astor. They sent
John Sergeant, of Philadelphia, abroad with authority to purchase some
millions of bullion; and his mission was calculated to impress on the
public the conviction that specie payments were to be resumed as soon
as the Bank could open its doors.</p>

<p>Hurried by Dallas, the Bank actually began its operations in January,
1817, and under the double pressure from the Treasury the State banks
had no choice but to yield. Another meeting was held at Philadelphia,
February 1, consisting of delegates from the banks of New York,
Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Richmond. The convention entered into
a compact with the Secretary of the Treasury to resume payments, on
certain conditions, at the day fixed by Congress. The compact was
carried into effect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span> February 20, a few days before the close of
Madison’s Presidency. Its success was magical. In New York, at ten
o’clock on the morning of February 20, specie was at two and one half
per cent premium. The banks opened their doors, and in half an hour all
was once more regular and normal.</p>

<p>Thus the worst financial evil of the war was removed within two
years after the proclamation of peace. A debt of about one hundred
and thirty millions remained; but the people which only twenty years
before had shrunk with fear and disgust from a debt of eighty millions,
gave scarcely a thought in 1816 to their funded obligations. The
difference between the two periods was not so much economical as
political. Population and wealth had increased, but the experience of
the people had advanced more rapidly than their numbers or capital.
In measuring the political movement shrewd judges might easily err,
for the elections of 1816 showed little apparent change in parties;
but in truth parties had outgrown their principles, and in politics,
as in finance, the close of Madison’s Administration obliterated old
distinctions.</p>

<p>Neither party admitted the abandonment of its dogmas. The New York
election in the spring of 1816 showed no considerable change in votes.
In 1810 Governor Tompkins was elected by ten thousand majority; even
in the dark days of 1813 he had a majority of thirty-six hundred;
in 1816, notwithstanding his popularity and the success of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
war administration, his majority was less than seven thousand. In
Massachusetts John Brooks, who succeeded Governor Strong as candidate
of the Federalist party, received forty-nine thousand five hundred
votes, while Samuel Dexter received forty-seven thousand four hundred.
Six years before, in 1810, the Republican candidate, Elbridge Gerry,
had received more than forty-six thousand five hundred, and Governor
Strong had polled only forty-four thousand. Apparently the Republicans
had lost ground in Massachusetts since 1810. In Connecticut, where the
election turned on church issues, the result was somewhat different.
The Anglican church, a small body but rich and influential, strongly
Federalist in politics and conservative in character, joined the
Democrats to overthrow the reign of the Congregational clergy. Oliver
Wolcott, a Federalist who supported the war, was their candidate; and
the combination nearly carried the State. Wolcott received about ten
thousand two hundred votes; his Federalist opponent was elected by
eleven thousand three hundred and seventy votes. The Federalists also
carried Rhode Island, once a strongly Democratic State, and seemed
socially as well as politically to be little affected by their many
mistakes and misfortunes.</p>

<p>Yet every one felt that real distinctions of party no longer
existed. The Anglicans of Connecticut, the Unitarians of Boston,
the Universalists and Baptists, looked chiefly to the overthrow of
the established New England church; and the Democrats of New York,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
like the Republicans of Virginia and North Carolina, labored for a
system of internal improvements and for increased energy in national
government. Parties, no longer held together by discipline, were liable
at any moment to fall into confusion; and, as frequently happened in
such stages of public opinion, they were extraordinarily affected by
influences seemingly trivial. In 1816 the relaxation of party spirit
resulted in a phenomenon never before witnessed. The whole community
rose against its own representatives, and showed evident pleasure in
condemning them. The occasion for this outbreak of popular temper was
the Compensation Bill; but the instinct that could alone account for
the public pleasure in punishing public men, could not be explained by
a cause so trifling as that Act.</p>

<p>At the next session of Congress, Calhoun, lapsing in the middle of
a speech into his usual meditative speculation, remarked, as though
he were perplexed to account for his own theory, that in his belief
the House of Representatives was not a favorite with the American
people.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Had he expressed the opinion that freedom of thought or
speech was not a favorite with the American people, he would have said
nothing more surprising. If the House was not a favorite, what part of
the government was popular, and what could be hoped for representative
government itself? Of all the machinery created by the Constitution,
the House alone directly reflected and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span> represented the people; and if
the people disliked it, they disliked themselves.</p>

<p>The people best knew whether Calhoun was right. Certainly the House,
owing in part to its size, its frequent elections and changes, its lack
of responsibility and of social unity, was the least steady and least
efficient branch of government. Readers who have followed the history
here closed, have been surprised at the frequency with which the word
<i>imbecility</i> has risen in their minds in reading the proceedings
of the House. So strong was the same impression at the time, that
in the year 1814, at the close of the war, every earnest patriot
in the Union, and many men who were neither earnest nor patriotic,
were actively reproaching the House for its final failure, at an
apparent crisis of the national existence, to call out or organize
any considerable part of the national energies. The people in truth,
however jealous of power, would have liked in imagination, though they
would not bear in practice, to be represented by something nobler,
wiser, and purer than their own average honor, wisdom, and purity. They
could not make an ideal of weakness, ignorance, or vice, even their
own; and as they required in their religion the idea of an infinitely
wise and powerful deity, they revolted in their politics from whatever
struck them as sordid or selfish. The House reflected their own
weaknesses; and the Compensation Act seemed to them an expression
of their own least agreeable traits. They rebelled against a petty
appropriation of money,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span> after enduring for years a constant succession
of worse offences.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Who would have believed,” asked John Randolph,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> six months
afterward,—“who would have believed,” he repeated, “that the
people of the United States would have borne all the privations
and losses of the late war, and of the measures that led to
it; that they would have quietly regarded a national debt,
swelled to an amount unknown,—to an amount greater than the
whole expense of our seven years’ war; that they would have
seen the election of President taken out of their hands [by the
caucus]; that they would have borne with abuse and peculation
through every department of the government,—and that the great
Leviathan, which slept under all these grievances, should be
roused into action by the Fifteen-Hundred-Dollar Law?”</p>
</div>

<p>Only with difficulty could members persuade themselves that the public
anger was real. They could not at first conceive that the people should
be seriously angry because Congress had thought proper to pay its
members a sum not in itself extravagant or adequate to their services.
Not until the members returned to their homes did they appreciate the
force of public feeling; but they soon felt themselves helpless to
resist it. Richard M. Johnson and Henry Clay, the two most popular
men in Kentucky, found their entire constituency attacking them.
“When I went home,” said Clay,<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> “I do not recollect to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span> met
with one solitary individual of any description of party who was not
opposed to the Act,—who did not, on some ground or other, think it an
improper and unjust law.” Benjamin Hardin,<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> another of the Kentucky
victims, said: “If a man came into the county court to be appointed
a constable or surveyor of the road, he entered his solemn protest
against the Compensation Law. If a petty demagogue wanted to get into
the legislature, he must post up, or put in the newspapers, his protest
against it.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There was at first a violent excitement,” said Philip P.
Barbour of Virginia;<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> “gentlemen might call it, if they
pleased, a storm. But that storm, even when its fury abated,
subsided into a fixed and settled discontent at the measure; it
met the disapprobation and excited the discontent of the grave,
the reflecting, and the deliberate; and such he believed to be
the case with an immense majority of the American people.”</p>
</div>

<p>Grand juries denounced it in Vermont and Georgia; the State legislature
denounced it in Massachusetts; town-meetings protested against it;
county conventions sat upon it; all classes and parties united in
condemning it, and the brunt of this sweeping popular reproval fell
upon the House of Representatives. Close as the House stood to the
people, its want of popularity was evident,—as Calhoun, with his
usual insight, bore witness. The House had as a body few friends and
no protection against popular tempests.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span> The first to suffer, it was
always the last to escape. One after another the weaker members gave
way, and either declined re-election or were not re-elected. The chiefs
succeeded for the most part by personal popularity in maintaining their
hold on their districts, although several leading members lost their
seats.</p>

<p>Even against so feeble and factious a body as the Thirteenth
Congress, such condemnation would have seemed exceptional; but the
peculiarity that made this popular reproof singular and suggestive
was the popular admission that the Fourteenth Congress, for ability,
energy, and usefulness, never had a superior, and perhaps, since the
First Congress, never an equal. Such abilities were uncommon in any
legislative body, American or European. Since Federalist times no
Congress had felt such a sense of its own strength, and such pride in
its own superiority; none had filled so fully the popular ideal of what
the people’s representatives should be. That this remarkable body of
men should have incurred almost instantly the severest popular rebuke
ever visited on a House of Representatives, could not have been mere
accident.</p>

<p>The politics of 1816 seemed absorbed in the Compensation Act, and in
the union of parties to condemn their representatives. The Senate
escaped serious censure; and President Madison, so far from being
called to account for errors real or imaginary, seemed to enjoy
popularity never before granted to any President at the expiration of
his term. The apparent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span> contentment was certainly not due to want of
grievances. The internal taxes pressed hard on the people, especially
in New England, where the suffering was general and in some places
severe; but no popular cry for reduction of taxes disturbed the
elections. No portion of the country seemed displeased that a fourth
Virginian should be made President by the intrigues of a Congressional
caucus. The State legislatures for the most part chose as usual the
Presidential electors; and in December the public learned, almost
without interest, that James Monroe had received one hundred and
eighty-three electoral votes, representing sixteen States, while
Rufus King had received thirty-four electoral votes, representing
Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Delaware. Daniel D. Tompkins of New
York was made Vice-President by the same process. Nothing in the
elections, either for President or for Congress, showed that the people
were disposed to scrutinize sharply the workings of any part of their
government except the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>As the winter approached when Madison was to meet Congress for the last
time, the sixteen years of his official service, which had been filled
with excitement and violence, were ending in political stagnation.
Party divisions had so nearly disappeared that nothing prevented the
President elect from selecting as the head of his Cabinet the son of
the last Federalist President, who had been the object of more violent
attack from the Republican party than had been directed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span> against any
other Federalist. Old Republicans, like Macon and John Randolph, were
at loss to know whether James Monroe or J. Q. Adams had departed
farthest from their original starting-points. At times they charged
one, at times the other, with desertion of principle; but on the
whole their acts tended to betray a conviction that J. Q. Adams was
still a Federalist in essentials, while Monroe had ceased to be an
old Republican. In the political situation of 1817, if Jefferson and
his contemporaries were right in their estimates, Federalist views of
government were tending to prevail over the views of the Jeffersonian
party.</p>

<p>With this tendency, the national prosperity and the state of the
Treasury had much to do. Dallas carried out his purpose, and in October
quitted the Treasury. In retiring, he left with the President a sketch
of the condition of the finances such as no previous secretary had been
so fortunate as to present. For the year ending Sept. 30, 1816, the
receipts amounted to $47,670,000.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> From the customs, which Dallas
had estimated at $21,000,000, duties to the amount of $36,000,000 were
received. A surplus of more than $20,000,000 was likely to accumulate
in the Treasury before the close of the year.</p>

<p>Old ideas of economy and strict restraints on expenditure could not
long maintain themselves in the presence of such an income; but besides
the temptation to expand the sphere of government in expenditures,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
other influences were at work to establish Federalist principles in the
system itself. Dallas remained in office chiefly in order to organize
the Bank, and to render certain the resumption of specie payments. When
he retired, in October, 1816, both objects were practically attained.
His administration of the Treasury had then lasted two years. He found
the government bankrupt; he left it with a surplus of twenty millions
for the year. His measures not only relieved the country from financial
disorders equalled only by those of the Revolutionary War, but also
fixed the financial system in a firm groove for twenty years. He
failed only in his attempt to obtain from Congress a larger degree of
protection for domestic industries. Had his scheme of protection been
adopted, possibly the violence of subsequent changes in revenue and
legislation might have been moderated, and certainly the result could
have been no more mischievous than it was.</p>

<p>Dallas retired to private life by his own wish, and the public three
months afterward heard with surprise and regret the news of his
sudden death. Like most of the men who rendered decisive services
during the war, he received no public reward commensurate with his
deserts. He fared better than Armstrong, who created the army; but
even Gallatin, who shaped the diplomatic result, was content to retire
into the comparative obscurity of the mission to Paris; while Perry
and Macdonough, whose personal qualities had decided the fortunes of
two campaigns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span> and won the military basis on which peace could be
negotiated, received no more reward than fell to the lot of third-rate
men. In the case of Dallas and Gallatin, the apparent neglect was
their own choice. Gallatin might have returned to the Treasury, but
declined it; and the President transferred W. H. Crawford from the War
Department to the charge of the finances, while Clay was offered the
War Department in succession to Crawford.</p>

<p>These arrangements affected Madison but little. He had no longer
an object to gain from the disposal of patronage, and he sought to
smooth the path of his successor rather than to benefit himself.
Few Presidents ever quitted office under circumstances so agreeable
as those which surrounded Madison. During the last two years of his
Administration almost every month brought some difficulty to an end, or
accomplished some long-desired result. The restoration of the finances
was perhaps his greatest source of satisfaction; but the steadiness
with which the whole country, except New England, recovered prosperity
and contentment afforded him a wider and more constant pleasure. The
ravages of war left few traces. Even at Washington the new public
buildings were pressed forward so rapidly that the effects of fire
were no longer seen. The Capitol began to rise from its ruins. The new
halls of Congress promised to do honor to Madison’s judgment. Benjamin
Latrobe was the architect in charge; and his Representative Chamber,
without reproducing that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span> which Jefferson had helped to design, was
dignified and worthy of its object. The old sandstone columns were
replaced by another material. On the shore of the Potomac, near
Leesburg, Latrobe noticed a conglomerate rock, containing rounded
pebbles of various sizes and colors, and capable of being worked in
large masses. His love of novelty led him to employ this conglomerate
as an ornamental stone for the columns of the Hall of Representatives;
and the effect was not without elegance.</p>

<p>Several years were still to pass before Congress occupied its permanent
quarters, and Madison did not return to the White House; but the traces
of national disaster disappeared in the process of reconstruction
before he quitted the Presidency.</p>

<p>Surrounded by these pleasant conditions, Madison saw Congress assemble
for the last time to listen to his requests. The Message which he sent
to the legislature December 3 showed the extinction of party issues,
and suggested no action that seemed likely to revive party disputes
in any new form. The President expressed regret at the depression
in shipping and manufactures, the branches of industry unfavorably
affected by the peace. He suggested that Congress should consider
especially the need of laws counteracting the exclusive navigation
system of Great Britain. He recommended once more the time-worn
subjects of the Militia and a National University. He asked for
legislation against the Slave Trade, and urged a re-modification of the
Judiciary.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span> He requested Congress to create a new Executive department
for Home or Interior Affairs, and to place the Attorney-General’s
office on the footing of a department. He gave a flattering account of
the finances; and his Message closed with a panegyric on the people and
their government, for seeking “by appeals to reason, and by its liberal
examples, to infuse into the law which governs the civilized world a
spirit which may diminish the frequency or circumscribe the calamities
of war, and meliorate the social and beneficent relations of peace: a
government, in a word, whose conduct, within and without, may bespeak
the most noble of all ambitions,—that of promoting peace on earth and
good-will to man.”</p>

<p>For the moment, Congressmen were too much interested in their own
quarrel to sympathize strongly with panegyrics on the people or their
government. The members of the House returned to Washington mortified,
angry, and defiant, disgusted alike with the public and with the public
service. No sooner were the standing committees announced, December 4,
than Richard M. Johnson moved for a special committee on the repeal
of the Compensation Law, and supported his motion in an unusually
elaborate speech, filled with argument, complaint, and irritation.
The committee was appointed,—Johnson at its head; William Findley of
Pennsylvania, second; Daniel Webster, third, with four other members.
After twelve days’ consideration, December 18, the committee presented
a report, written by Webster, defending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span> the Act, but recommending a
return to the <i>per diem</i> system, in deference to the popular wish.
The scale of the new allowance was left for Congress to determine.</p>

<p>Until this personal quarrel was discussed, no other business received
attention. The debate—postponed till Jan. 14, 1817, to save the
dignity of the House—lasted, to the exclusion of other business, until
January 23. As an exhibition of personal and corporate character,
it was entertaining; but it contained little of permanent interest
or value. Calhoun, always above his subject, spoke with much force
against yielding to popular outcry. “This House,” he said, “is the
foundation of the fabric of our liberty. So happy is its constitution,
that in all instances of a general nature its duty and its interests
are inseparable. If he understood correctly the structure of our
government, the prevailing principle is not so much a balance of power,
as a well-connected chain of responsibility. That responsibility
commenced here, and this House is the centre of its operation.”
The idea that the people had “resolved the government into its
original elements, and resumed to themselves their primitive power
of legislation,” was inconsistent with the idea that responsibility
commenced and centred in the House. “Are we bound in all cases to do
what is popular?” asked Calhoun. Could the House shift responsibility
from itself to the people without destroying the foundation of the
entire fabric?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span></p>

<p>Like most of Calhoun’s speculations, this question could receive its
answer only in some distant future. The Compensation Law lowered
permanently the self-respect of the House, which had already declined
from the formation of the government. “Of that House,” said Richard
Henry Wilde of Georgia,<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> “he feared it might be said in the
words of Claudian: ‘A fronte recedant imperii.’ Yes, sir, they were
receding,—they had receded from the front of empire. That House,
formerly the favorite of the American nation, the first and most
important branch of the government, the immediate image of the people,
had been losing, and continued to lose,—certainly by no fault of
theirs, but by the working of causes not for him to develop,—that rank
and power in the government originally belonging to them, and which
others at their expense had been secretly acquiring.” Yet the House,
while repealing the law, refused to admit itself in the wrong. The
law was repealed only so far as it applied to subsequent Congresses.
Leaving its successors to fix whatever compensation they thought proper
for their services, the Fourteenth Congress adhered to its own scale,
and took the money it was expected to refund.</p>

<p>Having disposed of this personal affair, the House turned to serious
business, and completed its remarkable career by enacting several
measures of far-reaching importance.</p>

<p>The first of these measures was a Navigation Act,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span> approved March
1, 1817, imposing on foreign vessels the same restrictions and
prohibitions which were imposed by foreign nations on Americans. The
second resembled the first in its object, but related only to the
importation of plaster of Paris from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.
These two Acts began a struggle against the foreign navigation systems,
which ended in their overthrow.</p>

<p>For the present the House postponed the establishment of an Interior
Department, and allowed the Attorney-General to remain without an
office or a clerk; but it passed an Act, approved March 3, 1817,
concentrating in the Treasury the accounting business of government,
and appointing four more auditors and one more comptroller for the
purpose.</p>

<p>The fourth and most important measure that became law was a Neutrality
Act, approved March 3, 1817, which authorized collectors of customs to
seize and detain “any vessel manifestly built for warlike purposes,
... when the number of men shipped on board, or other circumstances,
shall render it probable that such vessel is intended by the owner”
to cruise against the commerce of a friendly State. Nearly fifty
years were to pass before the people of the United States learned to
realize the full importance of this Act, which laid the foundation
for all the subsequent measures taken by the United States and Great
Britain for preserving neutrality in their relations with warring
countries.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> The Neutrality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span> Act of 1817 furnished the measure of
neutral obligations.</p>

<p>Besides these important laws, the Fourteenth Congress passed another
bill, which closed its own activity and that of President Madison. None
of the previous measures bore any direct relation to party politics,
either past or future; but the bill for internal improvements, which
Congress passed and the President vetoed, was an event of no small
meaning in party history.</p>

<p>Calhoun moved, December 16, “that a committee be appointed to inquire
into the expediency of setting apart ... a permanent fund for internal
improvement.” The committee was appointed the same day,—Calhoun,
Sheffey of Virginia, Creighton of Ohio, Grosvenor of New York, and
Ingham of Pennsylvania. December 23 Calhoun reported a bill<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
setting aside the bonus paid by the Bank, $1,500,000, and the future
dividends from Bank stock, “as a fund for constructing roads and
canals.” February 4 he introduced his bill by a speech, showing that a
system of internal improvements was necessary, and could, in certain
instances, be created by the national government alone.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Let it not be forgotten,” said Calhoun,<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> with the air of
sombre forecast which marked his mind and features, “let it be
forever kept in mind, that the extent of our republic exposes us
to the greatest of all calamities, next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span> to the loss of liberty,
and even to that in its consequence,—<i>disunion</i>. We are
great, and rapidly—I was about to say fearfully—growing. This
is our pride and danger, our weakness and our strength. Little
does he deserve to be intrusted with the liberties of this
people, who does not raise his mind to these truths. We are
under the most imperious obligation to counteract every tendency
to disunion.... If ... we permit a low, sordid, selfish, and
sectional spirit to take possession of this House, this happy
scene will vanish. We will divide, and in its consequences will
follow misery and despotism.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Constitutional question Calhoun reserved for the future; he thought
it scarcely worth discussion, since the good sense of the States might
be relied on to prevent practical evils. Nevertheless he discussed
it, and drew sufficient authority from the “general welfare” clause,
and from the power to “establish” post-roads. Granting that the
Constitution was silent, he saw no restraint on Congress:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If we are restricted in the use of our money to the enumerated
powers, on what principle can the purchase of Louisiana be
justified?... If it cannot, then are we compelled either to deny
that we had the power to purchase, or to strain some of the
enumerated powers to prove our right.”</p>
</div>

<p>The debate was interesting. Timothy Pickering, with the accumulated
experience of seventy years, suggested that the right to regulate
commerce among the several States, as in the case of light-houses and
beacons, covered the proposed appropriation. Clay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span> supported the bill
with his usual energy, avowing that among his strongest motives was the
wish to add this new distinction to the Fourteenth Congress, so harshly
judged by the people. The chief Constitutional argument against the
measure was made by Philip P. Barbour of Virginia; but other members
opposed it on different grounds, and chiefly because as long as the
internal taxes were still exacted, internal improvements should not be
undertaken.</p>

<p>If the final vote was a correct test, Constitutional objections had but
little weight with Congress. The bill passed the House, February 8, by
the small majority of eighty-six to eighty-four. Of the minority no
less than thirty-three were New England Federalists, whose opposition
was founded on local and sectional reasons. From the slave States about
forty-two votes were given against the bill; but a number of these were
Federalist, and others were influenced by peculiar reasons. Two thirds
of the Virginians voted against the bill; two thirds of the South
Carolinians voted in its favor. Probably not more than twenty-five
or thirty members, in the total number of one hundred and seventy,
regarded the Constitutional difficulty as fatal to the bill.</p>

<p>In the Senate the bill passed by a vote of twenty to fifteen. Of the
minority nine represented New England, and six represented Southern
States. Every senator from the Middle States, as well as both senators
from Virginia, supported the bill. Both senators from Massachusetts,
the Republican Varnum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span> and the Federalist Ashmun, opposed it; while
Jeremiah Mason of New Hampshire and Rufus King of New York voted in
its favor. The confusion of parties was extreme; but the State-rights
school of old Republicans seemed to command not more than five or six
votes in thirty-five.</p>

<p>The divisions on this bill seemed to leave no question that Congress by
an overwhelming majority regarded the Constitutional point as settled.
No one doubted that the Judiciary held the same opinion. The friends
of the bill had reason to feel secure in regard to the Constitutional
issue if on nothing else, and were the more disappointed when, March 3,
President Madison exercised for the last time his official authority by
returning the bill with a veto founded on Constitutional objections.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The power to regulate commerce among the several States,” he
said, “cannot include a power to construct roads and canals,
and to improve the navigation of water-courses in order to
facilitate, improve, and secure such a commerce, without a
latitude of construction departing from the ordinary import
of the terms, strengthened by the known inconveniences which
doubtless led to the grant of this remedial power to Congress.
To refer the power in question to the clause ‘to provide for the
common defence and general welfare’ would be contrary to the
established and consistent rules of interpretation, as rendering
the special and careful enumeration of powers which follow the
clause nugatory and improper. Such a view of the Constitution
would have the effect of giving to Congress a general power of
legislation.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span></p>

<p>Every one who looked at the Constitution as an instrument or machine
to be employed for the first time, must have admitted that Madison was
right. Interpreted by no other aid than its own terms and the probable
intent of a majority of the Convention which framed and the States
which adopted it, the Constitution contained, and perhaps had been
intended to contain, no power over internal improvements. The wide
difference of opinion which so suddenly appeared between the President
and Congress could not have been the result so much of different views
of the Constitution, as of conclusions reached since the Constitution
was framed. Congress held the bill to be Constitutional, not because
it agreed with the strict interpretation of the text, but because it
agreed with the interpretation which for sixteen years the Republican
party, through Congress and Executive, had imposed upon the text.</p>

<p>On that point Calhoun’s argument left no doubt; and his question—the
last of his speculations pregnant with future history—echoed
unanswered: “On what principle can the purchase of Louisiana be
justified?” Dismissing all other violations or violence offered to the
Constitution by President Madison or his predecessors,—such as the
Bank, the Embargo, the Enforcement laws, the laws for the government
of Orleans Territory, the seizure of West Florida,—Calhoun’s question
went to the heart of the issue between President and Congress.</p>

<p>From the Virginia side only one answer was possible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span> In returning
to their early views of resistance to centralization, Madison
and Jefferson must have maintained the invalidity of precedents
to affect the Constitution. The veto seemed to create a new
classification of public acts into such as were Constitutional;
such as were unconstitutional, but still valid; and such as were
both unconstitutional and invalid. The admitted validity of an act,
like the purchase of Louisiana, even though it were acknowledged to
be unconstitutional, did not create a precedent which authorized a
repetition of a similar act.</p>

<p>Viewed only from a political standpoint, the veto marked the first
decided reaction against the centralizing effect of the war.
Unfortunately for the old Republican party, whose principles were thus
for a second time to be adopted in appearance by a majority of the
people, sixteen years had affected national character; and although
precedents might not bind Congress or Executive, they marked the
movement of society.</p>

<p>The Veto Message of March 3, 1817, was Madison’s Farewell Address. The
next day he surrendered to Monroe the powers of government, and soon
afterward retired to Virginia, to pass, with his friend Jefferson, the
remaining years of a long life, watching the results of his labors.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Union, which contained 5,300,000 inhabitants in 1800,
numbered 7,240,000 in 1810, and 9,634,000 in 1820. At the close of
Madison’s Administration, in 1817, the population probably numbered not
less than 8,750,000 persons. The average rate of annual increase was
about three and five-tenths per cent, causing the population to double
within twenty-three years.</p>

<p>The rate of increase was not uniform throughout the country, but the
drift of population was well defined. In 1800 the five New England
States contained about 1,240,000 persons. Virginia and North Carolina,
united, then contained nearly 1,360,000, or ten per cent more than
New England. In 1820 the two groups were still nearer equality. New
England numbered about 1,665,000; the two Southern States numbered
1,700,000, or about two per cent more than New England. While these two
groups, containing nearly half the population of the Union, increased
only as one hundred to one hundred and twenty-nine, the middle group,
comprising New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, increased in the
relation of one hundred to one hundred and ninety-two,—from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span> 1,402,000
in 1800, to 2,696,000 in 1820. Their rate was about the average ratio
for the Union; and the three Western States,—Ohio, Kentucky, and
Tennessee,—grew proportionally faster. Their population of 370,000
in 1800 became 1,567,000 in 1820, in the ratio of one hundred to four
hundred and twenty-three.</p>

<p>Careful study revealed a situation alarming to New England and
Virginia. If only Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts, without
its district of Maine, were considered, a total population numbering
742,000 in 1800 increased only to 881,000 in 1820, or in the ratio of
one hundred to one hundred and eighteen in twenty years. If only the
white population of Virginia and North Carolina were taken into the
estimate, omitting the negroes, 852,000 persons in 1800 increased to
1,022,000 in 1820, or in the ratio of one hundred to one hundred and
twenty. Maryland showed much the same result, while Delaware, which
rose from 64,270 in 1800 to 72,674 in 1810, remained stationary,
numbering only 72,749 in 1820,—a gain of seventy-five persons in ten
years. The white population showed a positive decrease, from 55,361 in
1810 to 55,282 in 1820.</p>

<p>Probably a census taken in 1817 would have given results still less
favorable to the sea-coast. The war affected population more seriously
than could have been reasonably expected, and stopped the growth
of the large cities. New York in 1800 contained 60,000 persons; in
1810 it contained 96,400, but a corporation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span> census of 1816 reported
a population of only one hundred thousand, although two of the six
years were years of peace and prosperity. From that time New York grew
rapidly, numbering 124,000 in 1820,—a gain of about twenty-five per
cent in four years. Even the interior town of Albany, which should
have been stimulated by the war, and which increased four thousand
in population between 1800 and 1810, increased only three thousand
between 1810 and 1820. Philadelphia fared worse, for its population of
96,000 in 1810 grew only to 108,000 in 1820, and fell rapidly behind
New York. Baltimore grew from 26,000 in 1800 to 46,000 in 1810, and
numbered less than 63,000 in 1820. Boston suffered more than Baltimore;
for its population, which numbered 24,000 in 1800, grew only to 32,000
in 1810, and numbered but 43,000 in 1820. Charleston was still more
unfortunate. In 1800 its population numbered about eighteen thousand;
in 1810, 24,700; in 1817 a local census reported a decrease to 23,950
inhabitants, and the national census of 1820 reported 24,780, or eighty
persons more than in 1810. The town of Charleston and the State of
Delaware increased together by the same numbers.</p>

<p>Although the war lasted less than three years, its effect was so great
in checking the growth of the cities that during the period from 1810
to 1820 the urban population made no relative increase. During every
other decennial period in the national history the city population grew
more rapidly than that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span> the rural districts; but between 1810 and
1820 it remained stationary, at four and nine-tenths per cent of the
entire population. While Boston, Philadelphia, and Charleston advanced
slowly, and New York only doubled its population in twenty years,
Western towns like Pittsburg, Cincinnati, and Louisville grew rapidly
and steadily, and even New Orleans, though exposed to capture, more
than trebled in size; but the Western towns were still too small to
rank as important. Even in 1820 the only cities which contained a white
population of more than twenty thousand were New York, Philadelphia,
Baltimore, and Boston.</p>

<p>The severest sufferers from this situation were the three southern
States of New England,—Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts,
excluding the district of Maine, which was about to become a separate
State. Fortunately the northern part of New England, notwithstanding
the war, increased much more rapidly than the southern portion; but
this increase was chiefly at the cost of Massachusetts, and returned
little in comparison with the loss. The situation of Massachusetts
and Connecticut was dark. Had not wealth increased more rapidly than
population, Massachusetts would have stood on the verge of ruin; yet
even from the economical point of view, the outlook was not wholly
cheerful.</p>

<p>Judged by the reports of Massachusetts banks, the increase of wealth
was surprising. The official returns of 1803, the first year when such
returns were made, reported seven banks in the State, with a capital<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
of $2,225,000 and deposits of $1,500,000. In June, 1816, twenty-five
banks returned capital stock amounting nearly to $11,500,000 and
deposits of $2,133,000. The deposits were then small, owing to the
decline of industry and drain of specie that followed the peace, but
the capital invested in banks had more than quintupled in thirteen
years.</p>

<p>This multiplication was not a correct measure of the general increase
in wealth. Indeed, the banks were in excess of the public wants after
the peace, and their capital quickly shrunk from $11,500,000 in June,
1816, to $9,300,000 in June, 1817, a decline of nearly twenty per cent
in a year. From that time it began to increase again, and held its
improvement even in the disastrous year 1819. Assuming 1803 and 1817 as
the true terms of the equation, the banking capital of Massachusetts
increased in fourteen years from $2,225,000 to $9,300,000, or more than
quadrupled.</p>

<p>Gauged by bank discounts the increase of wealth was not so great. In
1803 the debts due to the banks were returned at $3,850,000; in June,
1817, they were $12,650,000. If the discounts showed the true growth
of industry, the business of the State somewhat more than trebled in
fourteen years. Probably the chief industries that used the increased
banking capital were the new manufactures, for the older sources
of Massachusetts wealth showed no equivalent gain. Tested by the
imports, the improvement was moderate. In 1800 the gross amount<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span> of
duties collected in Massachusetts was less than $3,200,000; in 1816
it somewhat exceeded $6,100,000, but had not permanently doubled in
sixteen years. Tested by exports of domestic produce, Massachusetts
showed no gain. In 1803 the value of such produce amounted to
$5,400,000; in 1816, to $5,008,000.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>Other methods of calculating the increase of wealth gave equally
contradictory results. The registered tonnage of Massachusetts
engaged in foreign trade exceeded two hundred and ten thousand tons
in 1800; in 1816 it was two hundred and seventy-four thousand tons.
In the coasting-trade Massachusetts employed seventy-five thousand
tons in 1800, and one hundred and twenty-nine thousand in 1816. The
tonnage employed in the fisheries showed no growth. The shipping of
Massachusetts seemed to indicate an increase of about forty per cent in
sixteen years.</p>

<p>The system of direct taxation furnished another standard of comparison.
In 1798 a valuation was made in certain States of houses and lands
for direct taxes; another was made in 1813; a third in 1815. That of
1798 amounted to eighty-four million dollars for Massachusetts; that
of 1813, to one hundred and forty-nine millions; that of 1815, to
one hundred and forty-three millions,—a gain of seventy per cent in
sixteen years; but such a valuation in 1817 would probably have shown a
considerable loss on that of 1815.</p>

<p>Evidently the chief increase in wealth consisted in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span> the growth of
manufactures, but after the prostration of the manufacturing interest
in 1816 no plausible estimate of their true value could be made,
unless the bank discounts measured their progress. The result of the
whole inquiry, though vague, suggested that wealth had increased in
Massachusetts more rapidly than population, and had possibly gained
seventy or eighty per cent in sixteen years;<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> but in spite of this
increase the State was in a pitiable situation. Neither steamboats,
canals, nor roads could help it. Thousands of its citizens migrated
to New York and Ohio, beyond the possibility of future advantage to
the land they left. Manufactures were prostrate. Shipping was driven
from the carrying trade. Taxation weighed far more heavily than ever
before. A load of obloquy rested on the State on account of its war
policy and the Hartford Convention. The national government treated it
with severity, and refused to pay for the Massachusetts militia called
into service by the President during the war, because the governor had
refused to place them under national officers.</p>

<p>The condition of Massachusetts and Maine was a picture of New England.
Democratic Rhode Island suffered equally with Federalist Connecticut.
Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont showed growth, but the chief
possibility of replacing lost strength lay in immigration. During
the European wars, no considerable number of immigrants were able to
reach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span> the United States; but immediately after the return of peace,
emigration from Europe to America began on a scale as alarming to
European governments as the movement to western New York and Ohio
was alarming to the seaboard States of the Union. During the year
1817 twenty-two thousand immigrants were reported as entering the
United States.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Twelve or fourteen thousand were probably Irish;
four thousand were German. More than two thousand arrived in Boston,
while about seven thousand landed in New York and the same number
in Philadelphia. The greater part probably remained near where they
landed, and in some degree supplied the loss of natives who went west.
The rapid growth of the northern cities of the sea-coast began again
only with the flood of immigration.</p>

<p>Although the three southern States of New England were the severest
sufferers, the Virginia group—comprising Delaware, Maryland, Virginia,
and North Carolina—escaped little better. In twenty years their white
population increased nineteen and five tenths per cent, while that of
Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island increased eighteen per
cent. The wealth of Southern States consisted largely in slaves; and
the negro population of the Virginia group increased about twenty-five
per cent in numbers during the sixteen years from 1800 to 1816. The
exports of domestic produce increased about forty per cent in value,
comparing the average of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span> 1801–1805 with that of 1815–1816. The net
revenue collected in Virginia increased nearly seventy per cent,
comparing the year 1815 with the average of the five years 1800–1804;
while that collected in North Carolina more than doubled.</p>

<p>Measured by these standards, the growth of wealth in the Virginia
group of States was not less rapid than in Massachusetts, and the same
conclusion was established by other methods. In 1816 Virginia contained
two State banks, with branches, which returned for January 1 a capital
stock of $4,590,000, with a note circulation of $6,000,000, and
deposits approaching $2,500,000. Their discounts amounted to $7,768,000
in January, 1816, and were contracted to $6,128,000 in the following
month of November.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Although Virginia used only half the banking
capital and credits required by Massachusetts, the rate of increase was
equally rapid, and the tendency toward banking was decided. In 1817
the legislature created two new banks, one for the valley of Virginia,
the other for western Virginia, with a capital stock of $600,000, and
branches with capital stock of $100,000 for each. Between 1800 and
1817, banking capital exceeding five million dollars was created in
Virginia, where none had existed before.</p>

<p>If the estimates made by Timothy Pitkin, the best statistician of the
time, were correct, the returns for direct taxes showed a greater
increase of wealth in Virginia than in Massachusetts.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> The
valuation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span> Virginia for 1799 was $71,000,000; that of 1815 was
$165,000,000. The valuation of North Carolina in 1799 was $30,000,000;
that of 1815 was $51,000,000. Maryland was estimated at $32,000,000
in 1799, at $106,000,000 in 1815. The average increase for the three
States was in the ratio of one hundred to two hundred and forty, while
that for Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut was nearer one
hundred to one hundred and seventy-five. The normal increase for the
Union was in the ratio of one hundred to two hundred and sixty-three.</p>

<p>The result obtained from the estimates for direct taxes was affected
by a doubt in regard to the correctness of the valuation of 1799,
which was believed to have been too low in the Southern States;
but the general conclusion could not be doubted that the Virginia
group of States increased steadily in wealth. The rapidity of
increase was concealed by an equally rapid impoverishment of the old
tobacco-planting aristocracy, whose complaints drowned argument. As the
lands of the ancient families became exhausted, the families themselves
fell into poverty, or emigrated to the richer Ohio valley. Their
decline or departure gave rise to many regrets and alarms. With the
impressions thus created, the people associated the want of economical
machinery as a cause of their backwardness, and became clamorous for
roads, canals, and banks. The revolution in their ideas between 1800
and 1816 was complete.</p>

<p>The North Carolinians were first to denounce their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span> old habits of
indifference, and to declare their State in danger of ruin on that
account. A committee of the State legislature reported Nov. 30,
1815, that vigorous measures for self-protection could no longer be
postponed:<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“With an extent of territory sufficient to maintain more
than ten millions of inhabitants, ... we can only boast of a
population something less than six hundred thousand, and it is
but too obvious that this population under the present state of
things already approaches its maximum. Within twenty-five years
past more than two hundred thousand of our inhabitants have
removed to the waters of the Ohio, Tennessee, and Mobile; and it
is mortifying to witness the fact that thousands of our wealthy
and respectable citizens are annually moving to the West, ...
and that thousands of our poorer citizens follow them, being
literally driven away by the prospect of poverty. In this state
of things our agriculture is at a stand.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Virginians showed an equally strong sense of their perils. Twelve
months after the North Carolina legislature took the matter in hand, a
committee of the Virginia legislature in December, 1816, discussed the
same topic and reached the same conclusion.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Although something
had been done by corporations to open canals on the Potomac, the James
River, and to the Dismal Swamp, the State of Virginia had in sixteen
years made little advance in material welfare. While New England had
built turnpikes wherever a profit could be expected, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span> Virginia,
said the committee, “the turnpike-roads of the Commonwealth, except
a few short passes of particular mountains and a road recently begun
from Fredericksburg to the Blue Ridge, are confined principally to
the county of Loudon, the adjacent counties of Fairfax, Fauquier, and
Frederick, and to the vicinity of the seat of government.” In other
respects the situation was worse.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“While many other States,” said the committee,<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> “have been
advancing in wealth and numbers with a rapidity which has
astonished themselves, the ancient Dominion and elder sister of
the Union has remained stationary. A very large proportion of
her western territory is yet unimproved, while a considerable
part of her eastern has receded from its former opulence. How
many sad spectacles do her low-lands present of wasted and
deserted fields, of dwellings abandoned by their proprietors,
of churches in ruins! The genius of her ancient hospitality,
benumbed by the cold touch of penury, spreads his scanty hoard
in naked halls, or seeks a coarser but more plenteous repast in
the lonely cabins of the West. The fathers of the land are gone
where another outlet to the ocean turns their thoughts from the
place of their nativity, and their affections from the haunts of
their youth.”</p>
</div>

<p>Another committee reported to the House of Delegates Jan. 5, 1816, in
favor of extending the banking system of the State.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> The report
used language new as an expression of Virginian opinions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Your committee believe that a prejudice has gone abroad,
which they confidently trust experience will prove to be
unfounded even to the satisfaction of those by whom it is
entertained, that the policy of Virginia is essentially hostile
to commerce and to the rights of commercial men. Upon the
removal of this prejudice must depend the future contributions
of this Commonwealth toward the prosperity and glory if not
the happiness and safety of the United States. Without the
confidence of foreigners there can exist no foreign commerce.
Without foreign commerce there can exist neither ships, seamen,
nor a navy; and a tremendous lesson has taught Virginia that
without a navy she can have no security for her repose.”</p>
</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the gloom of these recitals, the evidence tended
to show that while the white population of Virginia increased only
about nineteen per cent in sixteen years, its wealth nearly doubled.
Comparison with the quicker growth of the Middle States—New York, New
Jersey, and Pennsylvania—caused much of the uneasiness felt by New
England and Virginia. The banking capital of New York, which probably
did not much exceed three million dollars in 1800, amounted in 1816
to nearly $19,000,000; that of Pennsylvania exceeded $16,000,000. The
valuation of houses and lands for the direct tax rose in New York
from $100,000,000 in 1799 to nearly $270,000,000 in 1815; and in
Pennsylvania, from $102,000,000 in 1799 to $346,000,000 in 1815.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
The net revenue collected in New York<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span> was $2,700,000 in 1800, and
$14,500,000 in 1815; that collected in Pennsylvania was $1,350,000 in
1800, and $7,140,000 in 1815. This rate of increase did not extend to
exports. The value of the domestic exports from New York in 1803 was
about $7,500,000; in 1816 it exceeded $14,000,000; while the value of
Pennsylvanian exports increased little,—being $4,021,000 in 1803 and
$4,486,000 in 1816. The population of New York doubled while that of
Massachusetts and Virginia hardly increased one third. Pennsylvania
grew less rapidly in numbers, but still about twice as fast as New
England.</p>

<p>Although this rate of progress seemed to leave New England and Virginia
far behind the Middle States, it was less striking than the other
economical changes already accomplished or foreseen. The movement of
population or of wealth was not so important as the methods by which
the movement was effected. The invention of the steamboat gave a
decisive advantage to New York over every rival. Already in 1816 the
system had united New York city so closely with distant places that a
traveller could go from New York to Philadelphia by steamboat and stage
in thirteen hours; or to Albany in twenty-four hours; and taking stage
to Whitehall in twelve hours could reach Montreal in thirty hours, and
go on to Quebec in twenty-four hours,—thus consuming about five and a
half successive days in the long journey from Philadelphia to Quebec,
sleeping comfortably on his way, and all at an expense of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span> fifty
dollars. This economy of time and money was a miracle; but New York
could already foresee that it led to other advantages of immeasurable
value. The steamboat gave impetus to travel, and was a blessing to
travellers; but its solid gain for the prosperity of the United States
lay not in passenger traffic so much as in freight, and New York was
the natural centre of both.</p>

<p>While Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the Carolinas were building roads
and canals across a hundred miles of mountains, only to reach at last
an interior region which enjoyed an easier outlet for freight, New
York had but to people a level and fertile district, nowhere fifty
miles from navigable water, in order to reach the great Lake system,
which had no natural outlet within the Union except through the city
of New York. So obvious was the idea of a canal from the Lakes to the
Hudson that it was never out of men’s minds, even before the war; and
no sooner did peace return than the scheme took large proportions.
Active leaders of both political parties pressed the plan,—De Witt
Clinton, Gouverneur Morris, and Peter B. Porter were all concerned
in it; but the legislature and people then supposed that so vast an
undertaking as a canal to connect Lake Erie with the ocean, national in
character and military in its probable utility, required national aid.
Supposing the Administration to be pledged to the policy outlined by
Gallatin and approved by Jefferson in the Annual Message of 1806, the
New York commissioners applied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span> to Congress for assistance, and uniting
with other local interests procured the passage of Calhoun’s bill for
internal improvements.</p>

<p>They were met by Madison’s veto. This act, although at first it seemed
to affect most the interests of New York, was in reality injurious
only to the Southern States. Had the government lent its aid to the
Erie Canal, it must have assisted similar schemes elsewhere, and in
the end could hardly have refused to carry out Gallatin’s plan of
constructing canals from the Chesapeake to the Ohio, and from the
Santee to the Tennessee River. The veto disappointed New York only for
the moment, but was fatal to Southern hopes. After the first shock of
discouragement, the New York legislature determined to persevere, and
began the work without assistance. The legislature of Pennsylvania at
the same time appropriated half a million dollars for roads and canals,
and for improvements of river navigation, devoting nearly one hundred
and fifty thousand dollars to aid the turnpike-road to Pittsburg. The
fund established by the State of Ohio, as a condition of its admission
to the Union, had in 1816 produced means to construct the National or
Cumberland Road to the hundred and thirteenth mile. The indifference to
internal improvements which had been so marked a popular trait in 1800,
gave place to universal interest and activity in 1816; but the Middle
States were far in advance of the Eastern and Southern in opening
communications with the West; and New York, owing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span> in no small degree
to the veto, could already foresee the time when it would wrest from
Pennsylvania the supply of the valley of the Ohio, while expanding new
tributary territory to an indefinite extent along the Lakes.</p>

<p>When Madison retired from the Presidency, the limits of civilization,
though rapidly advancing, were still marked by the Indian boundary,
which extended from the western end of Lake Erie across Indiana,
Kentucky, Tennessee, and the Southwestern territory. Only weak and
helpless tribes remained east of the Mississippi, waiting until the
whites should require the surrender of their lands; but the whites,
already occupying land far in advance of their needs, could not yet
take the whole. Not until 1826 were the Indian titles generally
extinguished throughout Indiana. The military work was done, and
the short space of sixteen years had practically accomplished the
settlement of the whole country as far as the Mississippi; but another
generation was needed in order to take what these sixteen years had won.</p>

<p>As population spread, the postal service struggled after it. Except on
the Hudson River, steamboats were still irregular in their trips; and
for this reason the mails continued to be carried on horseback through
the interior. In 1801 the number of post-offices was 957; in 1817
it was 3,459. In 1801 the length of post-roads was less than 25,000
miles; in 1817 it was 52,689. In 1800 the gross receipts from postage
were $280,000; in 1817 they slightly exceeded $1,000,000.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span> In each
case the increase much surpassed the ratio for population, and offered
another means for forming some estimate of the increase of wealth. The
Fourteenth Congress pressed the extension of post-routes in western
New York, Ohio, and Indiana; they were already established beyond the
Mississippi. Rapidity of motion was also increased on the main routes.
From New York to Buffalo, four hundred and seventy-five miles, the
traveller went at an average rate of five miles an hour, and, sleeping
every night, he arrived in about four days. Between Philadelphia and
Pittsburg, where no watercourse shortened the distance, the stage-coach
consumed five and a half days, allowing for stoppage at night. These
rates of travel were equal to those common on routes of similar length
in Europe; but long after 1817 the mail from Washington to New Orleans,
by a route 1,380 miles in length, required twenty-four days of travel.</p>

<p>Had the steamboat system been at once perfected, the mail could have
been carried with much more rapidity; but the progress of the new
invention was slow. After the trial trip of the “Clermont,” Aug.
17, 1807, five years elapsed before the declaration of war; yet in
1812 New York possessed no other steamline than the Albany packets.
Steam-ferries plied to Hoboken, Amboy, and other places in the
immediate neighborhood; but neither Newport, New London, nor New Haven
enjoyed steam communication with New York until after the war. In the
spring of 1813 eight or nine steamboats belonged to the city of New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
York, but only three, which ran to Albany, were more than ferries.
At the same time Philadelphia possessed six such ferry-boats. From
Baltimore a steamer ran to the head of Chesapeake Bay; but the southern
coast and the town of Charleston saw no steamboat until a year after
the war was ended.</p>

<p>The West was more favored. In 1811 a boat of four hundred tons was
built at Pittsburg and sent down the river to New Orleans, where it
plied between New Orleans and Natchez. Two more were built at the same
place in 1813–1814; and one of them, the “Vesuvius,” went down the
river in the spring of 1814, rousing general interest in the midst of
war by making the trip in nine days and a half, or two hundred and
twenty-seven hours. The “Vesuvius” remained on the Mississippi for the
next two years, but was burned with her cargo in the summer of 1816. By
that time the world was thinking much of steamboats, and their use was
rapidly extending, though regular trips were still uncommon except in
the east.</p>

<p>The result of the sixteen years, considered only in the economical
development of the Union, was decisive. Although population increased
more rapidly than was usual in human experience, wealth accumulated
still faster. From such statistics as the times afforded, a strong
probability has been shown that while population doubled within
twenty-three years, wealth doubled within twenty. Statistics covering
the later period of national growth, warrant the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span> belief that a
valuation of $1,742,000,000 in 1800 corresponded to a valuation of
$3,734,000,000 in 1820; and that if a valuation of $328 per capita is
assumed for 1800, a valuation of $386 per capita may be estimated for
1820.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>These sixteen years set at rest the natural doubts that had attended
the nation’s birth. The rate of increase both in population and wealth
was established and permanent, unless indeed it should become even more
rapid. Every serious difficulty which seemed alarming to the people of
the Union in 1800 had been removed or had sunk from notice in 1816.
With the disappearance of every immediate peril, foreign or domestic,
society could devote all its energies, intellectual and physical, to
its favorite objects. This result was not the only or even the chief
proof that economical progress was to be at least as rapid in the
future as at the time when the nation had to struggle with political
difficulties. Not only had the people during these sixteen years
escaped from dangers, they had also found the means of supplying their
chief needs. Besides clearing away every obstacle to the occupation
and development of their continent as far as the Mississippi River,
they created the steamboat, the most efficient instrument yet conceived
for developing such a country. The continent lay before them, like
an uncovered ore-bed. They could see, and they could even calculate
with reasonable accuracy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span> the wealth it could be made to yield. With
almost the certainty of a mathematical formula, knowing the rate of
increase of population and of wealth, they could read in advance their
economical history for at least a hundred years.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> movement of thought, more interesting than the movement
of population or of wealth, was equally well defined. In the midst of
political dissension and economical struggles, religion still took
precedence; and the religious movement claimed notice not merely for
its depth or for its universality, but also and especially for its
direction. Religious interest and even excitement were seen almost
everywhere, both in the older and in the newer parts of the country;
and every such movement offered some means of studying or illustrating
the development of national character. For the most part the tendency
seemed emotional rather than intellectual; but in New England the old
intellectual pre-eminence, which once marked the Congregational clergy,
developed a quality both new and distinctive.</p>

<p>The Congregational clergy, battling with the innate vices of human
nature, thought themselves obliged to press on their hearers the
consequences of God’s infinite wrath rather than those of his infinite
love. They admitted that in a worldly sense they erred, and they did
not deny that their preaching sometimes leaned to severity; but they
would have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span> false to their charge and undeserving of their high
character had they lost sight of their radical doctrine that every man
was by nature personally depraved, and unless born again could not hope
to see the kingdom of God. Many intellectual efforts had been made by
many ages of men to escape the logic of this doctrine, but without
success. The dogma and its consequences could not be abandoned without
abandoning the Church.</p>

<p>From this painful dilemma a group of young Boston clergymen made a new
attempt to find a path of escape. Their movement drew its inspiration
from Harvard College, and was simultaneous with the sway of Jefferson’s
political ideas; but the relationship which existed between religious
and political innovation was remote and wholly intellectual. Harvard
College seemed to entertain no feeling toward Jefferson but antipathy,
when in 1805 the corporation appointed Henry Ware, whose Unitarian
tendencies were well known, to be Hollis Professor of Theology. The
Unitarianism of Henry Ware and his supporters implied at that time
no well-defined idea beyond a qualified rejection of the Trinity,
and a suggestion of what they thought a more comprehensible view of
Christ’s divine character; but it still subverted an essential dogma
of the Church, and opened the way to heresy. The Calvinists could no
longer regard Harvard College as a school proper for the training of
clergy; and they were obliged to establish a new theological seminary,
which they attached to a previously existing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span> Academy at Andover,
in Essex County, Massachusetts. The two branches of the New England
Calvinists—known then as old Calvinism and Hopkinsianism—united
in framing for the instructors of the Andover school a creed on the
general foundation of the Westminster Assembly’s Shorter Catechism,
and thus provided for the future education of their clergy in express
opposition to Unitarians and Universalists.</p>

<p>Thenceforward the theological school of Harvard College became more
and more Unitarian. The Massachusetts parishes, divided between the
two schools of theology, selected, as pleased a majority of their
church-members, either Orthodox or Unitarian pastors; and while
the larger number remained Calvinistic, though commonly preferring
ministers who avoided controversy, the Boston parishes followed the
Unitarian movement, and gradually filled their pulpits with young men.
The Unitarian clergy soon won for themselves and for their city a name
beyond proportion with their numbers.</p>

<p>Joseph Stevens Buckminster, the first, and while he lived the most
influential, of these preachers, began his career in 1805 by accepting
a call from one of the old Boston churches. He died in 1812 at the
close of his twenty-eighth year. His influence was rather social and
literary than theological or controversial. During his lifetime the
Unitarian movement took no definite shape, except as a centre of
revived interest in all that was then supposed to be best and purest
in religious, literary, and artistic feeling. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span> his death,
Unitarians learned to regard William Ellery Channing as their most
promising leader. Channing had accepted the charge of a Boston church
as early as 1803, and was about four years older than Buckminster. A
third active member of the Boston clergy was Samuel Cooper Thacher,
who took charge of a Boston parish in 1811, and was five years younger
than Channing. In all, some seven or eight churches were then called
Unitarian; but they professed no uniform creed, and probably no two
clergymen or parishes agreed in their understanding of the precise
difference between them and the Orthodox church. Shades of difference
distinguished each Unitarian parish from every other, and the degree
of their divergence from the old creed was a subject of constant
interest and private discussion, although the whole body of churches,
Congregational as well as Unitarian, remained in external repose.</p>

<p>The calm was not broken until the close of the war relieved New England
from a political anxiety which for fifteen years had restrained
internal dissensions. No sooner did peace restore to New England the
natural course of its intellectual movement than the inevitable schism
broke out. In June, 1815, the “Panoplist,” the mouthpiece of the
Congregational clergy, published an article charging the Unitarians
with pursuing an unavowed propaganda, and calling upon the Church to
refuse them communion. Channing and his friends thought the attack
to require reply, and, after consultation, Channing published<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span> a
“Letter to the Rev. Samuel C. Thacher,” which began a discussion and a
theological movement of no slight interest to American history.</p>

<p>Channing’s theology at that time claimed no merit for originality. His
letter to Thacher betrayed more temper than he would afterward have
shown; but in no particular was he more earnest than in repelling the
idea that he or his brethren were innovators. In whatever points they
disagreed, they were most nearly unanimous in repudiating connection
with the English Unitarians who denied the divinity of Christ. Channing
declared “that a majority of our brethren believe that Jesus Christ
is more than man; that he existed before the world; that he literally
came from heaven to save our race; that he sustains other offices than
those of a teacher and witness to the truth; and that he still acts
for our benefit, and is our intercessor with the Father.” So far was
Channing from wishing to preach a new theology that he would gladly
have accepted the old had he thought it intelligible:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is from deep conviction that I have stated once and again
that the differences between Unitarians and Trinitarians lie
more in sounds than in ideas; that a barbarous phraseology is
the chief wall of partition between these classes of Christians;
and that could Trinitarians tell us what they mean, their system
would generally be found little else than a mystical form of the
Unitarian doctrine.”</p>
</div>

<p>Calvinists could not be blamed for thinking that their venerable creed,
the painful outcome of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span> closest and most strenuous reasoning
known in the Christian world, was entitled to more respect than to be
called “little else than a mystical form of the Unitarian doctrine.”
The Unitarians themselves scarcely attempted to make the infinite
more intelligible to the finite by any new phraseology. They avowed
a dislike for dogma as their merit. During these early years they
systematically avoided controversy; in the pulpit they never assailed
and seldom mentioned other forms of Christian faith, or even the scheme
of Trinity which caused their schism.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“So deeply are we convinced,” said Channing’s letter, “that
the great end of preaching is to promote a spirit of love,
a sober, righteous, and godly life, and that every doctrine
is to be urged simply and exclusively for this end, that we
have sacrificed our ease, and have chosen to be less striking
preachers rather than to enter the lists of controversy.”</p>
</div>

<p>Yet the popular dislike of Calvinistic severity could not wholly make
good the want of doctrinal theology. The Unitarian clergy, however
unwilling to widen the breach between themselves and the old Church,
were ill at ease under the challenges of Orthodox critics, and could
not escape the necessity of defining their belief.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“According to your own concession,” rejoined Dr. Samuel
Worcester to Channing’s letter, “the party in whose behalf you
plead generally deny the essential divinity of the Saviour, and
hold him to be a being entirely ‘distinct from God,’ entirely
‘dependent,’—in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span> other words, a mere creature.... You doubtless
do not suppose that by any mere creature atonement could be made
for the sins of an apostate world of sufficient merit for the
pardon, sanctification, and eternal salvation of all who should
trust in him; therefore if you hold to atonement in any sense,
yet unquestionably not in the sense of a proper propitiatory
sacrifice. Upon this denial of atonement must follow of course
the denial of pardon procured by the blood of Christ, of
justification through faith in him, of redemption from eternal
death unto everlasting life by him. Connected, and generally if
not invariably concomitant, with the denial of these doctrines
is a denial of the Holy Spirit in his personal character and
offices, and of the renewal of mankind unto holiness by his
sovereign agency, as held by Orthodox Christians. Now, sir, are
these small and trivial points of difference between you and us?”</p>
</div>

<p>Channing protested against these inferences; but he did not
deny—indeed, he affirmed—that Unitarians regarded dogma as
unnecessary to salvation. “In our judgment of professed Christians,”
he replied, “we are guided more by their temper and lives than by any
peculiarities of opinion. We lay it down as a great and indisputable
opinion, clear as the sun at noonday, that the great end for which
Christian truth is revealed is the sanctification of the soul, the
formation of the Christian character; and wherever we see the marks of
this character displayed in a professed disciple of Jesus, we hope, and
rejoice to hope, that he has received all the truth which is necessary
to his salvation.” The hope might help to soothe anxiety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span> and distress,
but it defied conclusions reached by the most anxious and often renewed
labors of churchmen for eighteen hundred years. Something more than a
hope was necessary as the foundation of a faith.</p>

<p>Not until the year 1819, did Channing quit the cautious attitude he
at first assumed. Then, in his “Sermon on the Ordination of Jared
Sparks” at Baltimore, he accepted the obligation to define his relation
to Christian doctrine, and with the support of Andrews Norton, Henry
Ware, and other Unitarian clergymen gave a doctrinal character to
the movement. With this phase of his influence the present story has
nothing to do. In the intellectual development of the country, the
earlier stage of Unitarianism was more interesting than the later,
for it marked a general tendency of national thought. At a time when
Boston grew little in population and but moderately in wealth, and
when it was regarded with antipathy, both political and religious, by
a vast majority of the American people, its society had never been so
agreeable or so fecund. No such display of fresh and winning genius
had yet been seen in America as was offered by the genial outburst
of intellectual activity in the early days of the Unitarian schism.
No more was heard of the Westminster doctrine that man had lost all
ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation, but was
dead in sin. So strong was the reaction against old dogmas that for
thirty years society seemed less likely to resume the ancient faith
in the Christian Trinity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span> than to establish a new Trinity, in which a
deified humanity should have place. Under the influence of Channing and
his friends, human nature was adorned with virtues hardly suspected
before, and with hopes of perfection on earth altogether strange to
theology. The Church then charmed. The worth of man became under
Channing’s teachings a source of pride and joy, with such insistence as
to cause his hearers at last to recall, almost with a sense of relief,
that the Saviour himself had been content to regard them only as of
more value than many sparrows.</p>

<p>The most remarkable quality of Unitarianism was its high social and
intellectual character. The other more popular religious movements
followed for the most part a less ambitious path, but were marked by
the same humanitarian tendency. In contrast with old stringency of
thought, the religious activity of the epoch showed warmth of emotion.
The elder Buckminster, a consistent Calvinist clergyman, settled at
Portsmouth in New Hampshire, while greatly distressed by his son’s
leanings toward loose theology, was at the same time obliged to witness
the success of other opinions, which he thought monstrous, preached by
Hosea Ballou, an active minister in the same town. This new doctrine,
which took the name of Universalism, held as an article of faith “that
there is one God, whose nature is love, revealed in one Lord Jesus
Christ, by one Holy Spirit of grace, who will finally restore the
whole family of mankind to holiness and happiness.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span> In former times
any one who had publicly professed belief in universal salvation would
not have been regarded as a Christian. With equal propriety he might
have preached the divinity of Ammon or Diana. To the old theology
one god was as strange as the other; and so deeply impressed was Dr.
Buckminster with this conviction, that he felt himself constrained in
the year 1809 to warn Hosea Ballou of his error, in a letter pathetic
for its conscientious self-restraint. Yet the Universalists steadily
grew in numbers and respectability, spreading from State to State
under Ballou’s guidance, until they became as well-established and as
respectable a church as that to which Buckminster belonged.</p>

<p>A phenomenon still more curious was seen in the same year, 1809, in
western Pennsylvania. Near the banks of the Monongahela, in Washington
County, a divergent branch of Scotch Presbyterianism established a
small church, and under the guidance of Thomas Campbell, a recent
emigrant from Scotland, issued, Sept. 7, 1809, a Declaration:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Being well aware from sad experience of the heinous nature and
pernicious tendency of religious controversy among Christians,
tired and sick of the bitter jarrings and janglings of a party
spirit, we would desire to be at rest; and were it possible,
would also desire to adopt and recommend such measures as would
give rest to our brethren throughout all the churches, as would
restore unity, peace, and purity to the whole Church of God.
This desirable rest, however, we utterly despair either to find
for ourselves, or to be able to recommend to our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span> brethren, by
continuing amid the diversity and rancor of party contentions
the varying uncertainty and clashings of human opinions;
nor indeed can we reasonably expect to find it anywhere but
in Christ and his simple word, which is the same yesterday,
to-day, and forever. Our desire, therefore, for ourselves and
our brethren would be that rejecting human opinions and the
inventions of men as of any authority, or as having any place
in the Church of God, we might forever cease from further
contentions about such things, returning to and holding fast by
the original standard.”</p>
</div>

<p>Campbell’s Declaration expressed so wide a popular want that his
church, in a few years, became one of the largest branches of the
great Baptist persuasion. Perhaps in these instances of rapid popular
grouping, love of peace was to some extent supplemented by jealousy
of learning, and showed as much spirit of social independence as of
religious instinct. The growth of vast popular sects in a democratic
community might testify to intellectual stagnation as well as to
religious or social earnestness; but whatever was the amount of thought
involved in such movements, one character was common to them all, as
well as to the Unitarians,—they agreed in relaxing the strictness of
theological reasoning. Channing united with Campbell in suggesting that
the Church should ignore what it could not comprehend. In a popular and
voluntary form they proposed self-restraints which should have the same
effect as the formal restraints of the hierarchies. “Rejecting,” like
Campbell, “human opinions and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span> the inventions of men,”—preaching, like
Channing and Ballou, “that there is one God, whose nature is love,” and
that doctrine was useless except to promote a spirit of love,—they
founded new churches on what seemed to resemble an argument that the
intellectual difficulties in their path must be unessential because
they were insuperable.</p>

<p>Wide as the impulse was to escape the rigor of bonds and relax the
severity of thought, organizations so deeply founded as the old
churches were not capable of destruction. They had seen many similar
human efforts, and felt certain that sooner or later such experiments
must end in a return to the old standards. Even the Congregational
Church of New England, though reduced in Boston to a shadow of its
old authority, maintained itself at large against its swarm of
enemies,—Unitarian, Universalist, Baptist, Methodist,—resisting,
with force of character and reasoning, the looseness of doctrine and
vagueness of thought which marked the time. Yale College remained true
to it. Most of the parishes maintained their old relations. If the
congregations in some instances crumbled away or failed to increase,
the Church could still stand erect, and might reflect with astonishment
on its own strength, which survived so long a series of shocks
apparently fatal. For half a century the Congregational clergy had
struggled to prevent innovation, while the people emigrated by hundreds
of thousands in order to innovate. Obliged to insist on the infinite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
justice rather than on the infinite mercy of God, they shocked the
instincts of the new generation, which wanted to enjoy worldly
blessings without fear of future reckoning. Driven to bay by the
deistic and utilitarian principles of Jefferson’s democracy, they fell
into the worldly error of defying the national instinct, pressing their
resistance to the war until it amounted to treasonable conspiracy. The
sudden peace swept away much that was respectable in the old society
of America, but perhaps its noblest victim was the unity of the New
England Church.</p>

<p>The Church, whether Catholic or Protestant, Lutheran or Calvinistic,
always rested in the conviction that every divergence from the great
highways of religious thought must be temporary, and that no permanent
church was possible except on foundations already established; but the
State stood in a position less self-confident. The old principles of
government were less carefully developed, and Democrats in politics
were more certain than Unitarians or Universalists in theology that
their intellectual conclusions made a stride in the progress of
thought. Yet the sixteen years with which the century opened were
singularly barren of new political ideas. Apparently the extreme
activity which marked the political speculations of the period between
1775 and 1800, both in America and in Europe, had exhausted the energy
of society, for Americans showed interest only in the practical
working of their experiments, and added nothing to the ideas that
underlay them. With<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span> such political thought as society produced,
these pages have been chiefly filled; the result has been told. The
same tendency which in religion led to reaction against dogma, was
shown in politics by general acquiescence in practices which left
unsettled the disputed principles of government. No one could say with
confidence what theory of the Constitution had prevailed. Neither
party was satisfied, although both acquiesced. While the Legislative
and Executive branches of the government acted on no fixed principle,
but established precedents at variance with any consistent theory,
the Judiciary rendered so few decisions that Constitutional law stood
nearly still. Only at a later time did Chief-Justice Marshall begin
his great series of judicial opinions,—McCulloch against the State of
Maryland in 1819; Dartmouth College in the same year; Cohens against
the State of Virginia in 1821. No sooner were these decisive rulings
announced, than they roused the last combative energies of Jefferson
against his old enemy the Judiciary: “That body, like gravity, ever
acting, with noiseless foot and unalarming advance, gaining ground
step by step, and holding what it gains, is engulfing insidiously the
special governments.”</p>

<p>Marshall had few occasions to decide Constitutional points during the
Administrations of Jefferson and Madison, but the opinions he gave
were emphatic. When Pennsylvania in 1809 resisted, in the case of
Gideon Olmstead, a process of the Supreme Court,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span> the chief-justice,
without unnecessary words, declared that “if the legislatures of the
several States may at will annul the judgments of the courts of the
United States, and destroy the rights acquired under those judgments,
the Constitution itself becomes a solemn mockery, and the nation is
deprived of the means of enforcing its laws by the instrumentality
of its own tribunals.” Pennsylvania yielded; and Marshall, in the
following year, carried a step further the authority of his court. He
overthrew the favorite dogma of John Randolph and the party of States
rights, so long and vehemently maintained in the Yazoo dispute.</p>

<p>The Yazoo claims came before the court in the case of Fletcher against
Peck, argued first in 1809 by Luther Martin, J. Q. Adams, and Robert
G. Harper; and again in 1810 by Martin, Harper, and Joseph Story.
March 16, 1810, the chief-justice delivered the opinion. Declining,
as “indecent in the extreme,” to enter into an inquiry as to the
corruption of “the sovereign power of a State,” he dealt with the issue
whether a legislature could annul rights vested in an individual by a
law in its nature a contract.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It may well be doubted,” he argued, “whether the nature of
society and government does not prescribe some limits to the
legislative power; and if any are to be prescribed, where are
they to be found if the property of an individual, fairly and
honestly acquired, may be seized without compensation? To the
legislature all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span> legislative power is granted; but the question
whether the act of transferring the property of an individual to
the public be in the nature of the legislative power, is well
worthy of serious reflection. It is the peculiar province of
the legislature to prescribe general rules for the government
of society: the application of those rules to individuals in
society would seem to be the duty of other departments. How
far the power of giving the law may involve every other power,
in cases where the Constitution is silent, never has been and
perhaps never can be definitely stated.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the case under consideration, Marshall held that the Constitution
was not silent. The provision that no State could pass any law
impairing the obligation of contracts, as well as “the general
principles which are common to our free institutions,” restrained the
State of Georgia from passing a law whereby the previous contract
could be rendered void. His decision settled, as far as concerned the
Judiciary, a point regarded as vital by the States-rights school.
Four years afterward Congress gave the required compensation for the
contract broken by Georgia.</p>

<p>The chief-justice rendered no more leading Constitutional decisions
during Madison’s term of office; but his influence was seen in a
celebrated opinion delivered by Justice Story in 1816, in the case of
Martin against Hunter’s Lessee. There the court came in conflict with
the State of Virginia. The Court of Appeals of that State refused to
obey a mandate of the Supreme Court, alleging that the proceedings
of the Supreme Court were <i>coram non<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span> judice</i>, or beyond its
jurisdiction, being founded on section 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789,
which was unconstitutional in extending the appellate jurisdiction of
the Supreme Court over the State courts.</p>

<p>The Court of Appeals was unfortunate in the moment of its resistance
to the authority of the national courts. While the case was passing
through its last stage peace was declared, and the national authority
sprang into vigor unknown before. The chief-justice would not with
his own hand humiliate the pride of the Court of Appeals, for which
as a Virginian and a lawyer he could feel only deep respect. He
devolved the unpleasant duty on young Justice Story, whose own State
of Massachusetts was then far from being an object of jealousy to
Virginia, and who, a Republican in politics, could not be prejudiced
by party feeling against the Virginia doctrine. Much of the opinion
bore the stamp of Marshall’s mind; much showed the turn of Story’s
intelligence; yet the same principle lay beneath the whole, and no
one could detect a divergence between the Federalism of the Virginia
chief-justice and the Democracy of the Massachusetts lawyer.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It has been argued,” said the court, “that such an appellate
jurisdiction over State courts is inconsistent with the genius
of our governments and the spirit of the Constitution; that
the latter was never designed to act upon State sovereignties,
but only upon the people; and that if the power exists, it
will materially impair the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span> sovereignty of the States and the
independence of their courts. We cannot yield to the force of
this reasoning; it assumes principles which we cannot admit,
and draws conclusions to which we do not yield our assent. It
is a mistake that the Constitution was not designed to operate
upon States in their corporate capacity. It is crowded with
provisions which restrain or annul the sovereignty of the States
in some of the highest branches of their prerogatives.... When,
therefore, the States are stripped of some of the highest
attributes of sovereignty, and the same are given to the United
States; when the legislatures of the States are in some respects
under the control of Congress, and in every case are, under the
Constitution, bound by the paramount authority of the United
States,—it is certainly difficult to support the argument
that the appellate power over the decisions of State courts is
contrary to the genius of our institutions.”</p>
</div>

<p>So far were the political principles of the people from having united
in a common understanding, that while the Supreme Court of the United
States thus differed from the Virginia Court of Appeals in regard
to the genius of the government and the spirit of the Constitution,
Jefferson still publicly maintained that the national and state
governments were “as independent, in fact, as different nations,” and
that the function of one was foreign, while that of the other was
domestic. Madison still declared that Congress could not build a road
or clear a watercourse; while Congress believed itself authorized to do
both, and in that belief passed a law which Madison vetoed. In politics
as in theology, the practical system which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span> resulted from sixteen years
of experience seemed to rest on the agreement not to press principles
to a conclusion.</p>

<p>No new idea was brought forward, and the old ideas, though apparently
incapable of existing together, continued to exist in rivalry like
that of the dogmas which perplexed the theological world; but between
the political and religious movement a distinct difference could
be seen. The Church showed no tendency to unite in any creed or
dogma,—indeed, religious society rather tended to more divisions;
but in politics public opinion slowly moved in a fixed direction. The
movement could not easily be measured, and was subject to reaction;
but its reality was shown by the protests of Jefferson, the veto of
Madison, and the decisions of the Supreme Court. No one doubted that
a change had occurred since 1798. The favorite States-rights dogma
of that time had suffered irreparable injury. For sixteen years the
national government in all its branches had acted, without listening
to remonstrance, on the rule that it was the rightful interpreter of
its own powers. In this assumption the Executive, the Legislature, and
the Judiciary had agreed. Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, as well as
Virginia and Georgia, yielded. Louisiana had been bought and admitted
into the Union; the Embargo had been enforced; one National Bank had
been destroyed and another established; every essential function of a
sovereignty had been performed, without an instance of failure, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
not without question. However unwilling the minority might be to admit
in theory the overthrow of their principles, every citizen assented
in daily practice to the rule that the national government alone
interpreted its own powers in the last resort. From the moment the
whole people learned to accept the practice, the dispute over theory
lost importance, and the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 marked only a
stage in the development of a sovereignty.</p>

<p>The nature of the sovereignty that was to be the result of American
political experiment, the amount of originality which could be infused
into an idea so old, was a matter for future history to settle. Many
years were likely to elapse before the admitted practice of the
government and people could be fully adopted into the substance of
their law, but the process thus far had been rapid. In the brief space
of thirty years, between 1787 and 1817,—a short generation,—the Union
had passed through astonishing stages. Probably no great people ever
grew more rapidly and became more mature in so short a time. The ideas
of 1787 were antiquated in 1815, and lingered only in districts remote
from active movement. The subsidence of interest in political theories
was a measure of the change, marking the general drift of society
toward practical devices for popular use, within popular intelligence.
The only work that could be said to represent a school of thought in
politics was written by John Taylor of Caroline, and was probably never
read,—or if read, certainly never understood,—north<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span> of Baltimore by
any but curious and somewhat deep students, although to them it had
value.</p>

<p>John Taylor of Caroline might without irreverence be described as a
<i>vox clamantis</i>,—the voice of one crying in the wilderness.
Regarded as a political thinker of the first rank by Jefferson, Monroe,
John Randolph, and the Virginia school, he admitted, with the geniality
of the class to which he belonged, that his disciples invariably
deserted in practice the rules they praised in his teaching; but he
continued to teach, and the further his scholars drifted from him the
more publicly and profusely he wrote. His first large volume, “An
Inquiry into the Principles and Policy of the Government of the United
States,” published in 1814, during the war, was in form an answer
to John Adams’s “Defence of the Constitutions” published in London
twenty-five years before. In 1787 John Adams, like Jefferson, Hamilton,
Madison, Jay, and other constitution-makers, might, without losing the
interest of readers, indulge in speculations more or less visionary in
regard to the future character of a nation yet in its cradle; but in
1814 the character of people and government was formed; the lines of
their activity were fixed. A people which had in 1787 been indifferent
or hostile to roads, banks, funded debt, and nationality, had become in
1815 habituated to ideas and machinery of the sort on a great scale.
Monarchy or aristocracy no longer entered into the public mind as
factors in future development. Yet Taylor resumed the discussions of
1787 as though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span> the interval were a blank; and his only conclusion from
the experience of thirty years was that both political parties were
equally moving in a wrong direction.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The two parties, called Republican and Federal,” he concluded,
“have hitherto undergone but one revolution. Yet each when
in power preached Filmer’s old doctrine of passive obedience
in a new form, with considerable success; and each, out of
power, strenuously controverted it. The party in power asserted
that however absurd or slavish this doctrine was under other
forms of the numerical analysis, the people under ours were
<i>identified</i> (the new term to cog this old doctrine upon
the United States) with the government; and that therefore an
opposition to the government was an opposition to the nation
itself.... This identifying doctrine ... puts an end to the
idea of a responsibility of the government to the nation; ...
it renders useless the freedom of speech and of the press; it
converts the representative into the principal; it destroys the
division of power between the people and the government, as
being themselves indivisible; and in short it is inconsistent
with every principle by which politicians and philosophers have
hitherto defined a free government.”</p>
</div>

<p>The principle to which Taylor so strenuously objected was nevertheless
the chief political result of national experience. Somewhere or another
a point was always reached where opposition became treasonable,—as
Virginia, like Massachusetts, had learned both when in power and when
out. Taylor’s speculations ended only in an admission of their own
practical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span> sterility, and his suggestions for restraining the growth
of authority assumed the possibility of returning to the conditions of
1787. Banks were his horror. Stocks and bonds, or paper evidences of
indebtedness in any form, he thought destructive to sound principles of
government. The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 were his best
resource for the preservation of civil liberty. However wellfounded his
fears might be, his correctives could no longer be applied. Political
philosophers of all ages were fond of devising systems for imaginary
Republics, Utopias, and Oceanas, where practical difficulties could
not stand in their way. Taylor was a political philosopher of the
same school, and his Oceana on the banks of the Rappahannock was a
reflection of his own virtues.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Society</span> showed great interest in the statesmen or preachers
who won its favor, and earnestly discussed the value of political or
religious dogmas, without betraying a wish to subject itself ever again
to the rigor of a strict creed in politics or religion. In a similar
spirit it touched here and there, with a light hand, the wide circuit
of what was called <i>belles lettres</i>, without showing severity
either in taste or temper.</p>

<p>For the first four or five years of the century, Dennie’s “Portfolio”
contained almost everything that was produced in the United States
under the form of light literature. The volumes of the “Portfolio” for
that period had the merit of representing the literary efforts of the
time, for Philadelphia insisted on no standard of taste so exacting
as to exclude merit, or even dulness, in any literary form. Jacobins,
as Dennie called Democrats, were not admitted into the circle of the
“Portfolio;” but Jacobins rarely troubled themselves with <i>belles
lettres</i>.</p>

<p>The “Portfolio” reflected a small literary class scattered throughout
the country, remarkable chiefly for close adhesion to established
English ideas. The English standard was then extravagantly Tory, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
the American standard was the same. At first sight the impression was
strange. A few years later, no ordinary reader could remember that
ideas so illiberal had seriously prevailed among educated Americans.
By an effort, elderly men could, in the next generation, recall a
time when they had been taught that Oliver Cromwell was a monster
of wickedness and hypocrisy; but they could hardly believe that at
any period an American critic coldly qualified “Paradise Lost,” and
“Avenge, O Lord, thy slaughtered saints,” as good poetry, though
written by a Republican and an enemy of established order. This was
the tone of Dennie’s criticism, and so little was it confined to him
that even young Buckminster, in his Phi Beta Kappa Oration of 1809,
which was regarded as making almost an epoch in American literature,
spoke of Milton’s eyes as “quenched in the service of a vulgar and
usurping faction,” and of Milton’s life as “a memorable instance of the
temporary degradation of learning.” Buckminster was then remonstrating
against the influence of politics upon letters rather than expressing
a political sentiment, but his illustration was colored by the general
prejudices of British Toryism. Half a century before, Dr. Johnson had
taken the tone of Tory patronage toward Milton’s genius, and Johnson
and Burke were still received in America as final authorities for
correct opinion in morals, literature, and politics. The “Portfolio”
regarded Johnson not only as a “superlative” moralist and politician,
but also as a “sublime”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span> critic and a “transcendent” poet. Burke and
Cicero stood on the same level, as masters before whose authority
criticism must silently bow.</p>

<p>Yet side by side with these conventional standards, the “Portfolio”
showed tendencies which seemed inconsistent with conservatism,—a
readiness to welcome literary innovations contradicting every
established canon. No one would have supposed that the critic who
accepted Johnson and Pope as transcendent poets, should also delight
in Burns and Wordsworth; yet Dennie was unstinted in praise of
poetry which, as literature, was hardly less revolutionary than the
writings of Godwin in politics. Dennie lost no opportunity of praising
Coleridge, and reprinted with enthusiasm the simplest ballads of
Wordsworth. Moore was his personal friend, and Moore’s verses his
models. Wherever his political prejudices were untouched, he loved
novelty. He seemed to respect classical authority only because it was
established, but his literary instincts were broader than those of
Jefferson.</p>

<p>The original matter of the “Portfolio” was naturally unequal, and
for the most part hardly better than that of a college magazine.
Dennie was apt to be commonplace, trivial, and dull. His humor was
heavy and commonly coarse; he allowed himself entire freedom, and no
little grossness of taste. Of scholarship, or scholarly criticism, his
paper showed great want. He tried to instruct as well as to amuse,
but society soon passed the stage to which his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span> writing belonged.
The circulation of the “Portfolio” probably never exceeded fifteen
hundred copies, and Dennie constantly complained that the paper
barely supported itself. When the Bostonians, in the year 1805, began
to feel the spirit of literary ambition, they took at once a stride
beyond Dennie’s power, and established a monthly magazine called the
“Anthology and Boston Review,” which in 1806 numbered four hundred
and forty subscribers. The undertaking was doubly remarkable; for the
Anthology Society which supported the Review combined with it the
collection of a library, limited at first to periodical publications,
which expanded slowly into the large and useful library known as the
Boston Athenæum. The Review and Library quickly became the centre of
literary taste in Boston, and, in the words of Josiah Quincy many years
afterward, might be considered as a revival of polite learning in
America. The claim was not unreasonable, for the Review far surpassed
any literary standards then existing in the United States, and was not
much inferior to any in England; for the Edinburgh was established only
in 1802, and the Quarterly not till 1809.</p>

<p>The Anthology Society, which accomplished the feat of giving to Boston
for the first time the lead of American literary effort, consisted
largely of clergymen, and represented, perhaps unintentionally, the
coming Unitarian movement. Its president and controlling spirit had no
sympathy with either division<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span> of the Congregational Church, but was a
clergyman of the Church of England. John Sylvester John Gardiner, the
rector of Trinity, occupied a peculiar position in Boston. Of American
descent, but English birth and education, he was not prevented by the
isolation of his clerical character from taking an active part in
affairs, and his activity was sometimes greater than his discretion.
His political sermons rivalled those of the Congregational ministers
Osgood and Parish, in their violence against Jefferson and the national
government; his Federalism was that of the Essex Junto, with a more
decided leaning to disunion; but he was also an active and useful
citizen, ready to take his share in every good work. When he became
president of the Anthology Society, he was associated with a clergyman
of Unitarian opinions as vice-president,—the Rev. William Emerson, a
man of high reputation in his day, but better known in after years as
the father of Ralph Waldo Emerson. The first editor was Samuel Cooper
Thacher, to whom, ten years afterward, Channing addressed his earliest
controversial letter. Young Buckminster and William Tudor, a Boston
man, who for the next twenty years was active in the literary life of
Massachusetts, were also original members. The staff of the “Anthology”
was greatly superior to ordinary editorial resources; and in a short
time the Review acquired a reputation for ability and sharpness of
temper never wholly forgiven. Its unpopularity was the greater because
its aggressiveness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span> took the form of assaults on Calvinism, which
earned the ill-will of the Congregational clergy.</p>

<p>Buckminster and Channing were the editor’s closest friends, and their
liberality of thought was remarkable for the time and place; yet the
point from which the liberality of Boston started would have been
regarded in most parts of the Union as conservative. Channing’s fear of
France and attachment to England were superstitious.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I will not say,” began his Fast Day Sermon in 1810, “that the
present age is as strongly marked or distinguished from all
other ages as that in which Jesus Christ appeared; but with
that single exception, perhaps the present age is the most
eventful the world has ever known. We live in times which have
no parallel in past ages; in times when the human character has
almost assumed a new form; in times of peculiar calamity, of
thick darkness, and almost of despair.... The danger is so vast,
so awful, and so obvious, that the blindness, the indifference,
which prevail argue infatuation, and give room for apprehension
that nothing can rouse us to those efforts by which alone the
danger can be averted. Am I asked what there is so peculiar and
so tremendous in the times in which we live?... I answer: In the
very heart of Europe, in the centre of the civilized world, a
new power has suddenly arisen on the ruins of old institutions,
peculiar in its character, and most ruinous in its influence.”</p>
</div>

<p>While Channing felt for France the full horror of his Federalist
principles, he regarded England with equivalent affection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I feel a peculiar interest in England,” he explained in a note
appended to the Fast Day Sermon; “for I believe that there
Christianity is exerting its best influences on the human
character; that there the perfections of human nature, wisdom,
virtue, and piety are fostered by excellent institutions, and
are producing the delightful fruits of domestic happiness,
social order, and general prosperity.”</p>
</div>

<p>The majority of Americans took a different view of the subject; but
even those who most strongly agreed with Channing would have been first
to avow that their prejudice was inveterate, and its consequences
sweeping. Such a conviction admitted little room for liberalism where
politics were, directly or remotely, involved. Literature bordered
closely on politics, and the liberalism of Unitarian Boston was bounded
even in literature by the limits of British sympathies. Buckminster’s
Phi Beta Kappa Oration of 1809 was as emphatic on this point as
Channing’s Fast Day Sermon of 1810 was outspoken in its political
antipathies.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is our lot,” said Buckminster, “to have been born in an age
of tremendous revolution, and the world is yet covered with the
wrecks of its ancient glory, especially of its literary renown.
The fury of that storm which rose in France is passed and spent,
but its effects have been felt through the whole system of
liberal education. The foul spirit of innovation and sophistry
has been seen wandering in the very groves of the Lyceum, and is
not yet completely exorcised, though the spell is broken.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span></p>

<p>The liberalism of Boston began in a protest against “the foul spirit
of innovation,” and could hardly begin at any point more advanced.
“Infidelity has had one triumph in our days, and we have seen learning
as well as virtue trampled under the hoofs of its infuriated steeds,
let loose by the hand of impiety.” From this attitude of antipathy to
innovation, the Unitarian movement began its attempts to innovate, and
with astonishing rapidity passed through phases which might well have
required ages of growth. In five years Channing began open attack upon
the foundation, or what had hitherto been believed the foundation, of
the Church; and from that moment innovation could no longer be regarded
as foul.</p>

<p>Of the intellectual movement in all its new directions, Harvard College
was the centre. Between 1805 and 1817 the college inspired the worn-out
Federalism of Boston with life till then unimagined. Not only did it
fill the pulpits with Buckminsters, Channings, and Thachers, whose
sermons were an unfailing interest, and whose society was a constant
stimulus, but it also maintained a rivalry between the pulpit and the
lecture-room. The choice of a new professor was as important and as
much discussed as the choice of a new minister. No ordinary political
event caused more social interest than the appointment of Henry Ware as
Professor of Theology in 1805. In the following year J. Q. Adams was
made Professor of Rhetoric, and delivered a course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span> of lectures, which
created the school of oratory to which Edward Everett’s generation
adhered. Four younger men, whose influence was greatly felt in their
branches of instruction, received professorships in the next few
years,—Jacob Bigelow, who was appointed Professor of Medicine in
1813; Edward Everett, Greek Professor in 1815; John Collins Warren,
Professor of Anatomy in the same year; and George Ticknor, Professor
of <i>Belles Lettres</i> in 1816. In the small society of Boston, a
city numbering hardly forty thousand persons, this activity of college
and church produced a new era. Where thirty-nine students a year had
entered the college before 1800, an average number of sixty-six entered
it during the war, and took degrees during the four or five subsequent
years. Among them were names familiar to the literature and politics of
the next half century. Besides Ticknor and Everett, in 1807 and 1811,
Henry Ware graduated in 1812, and his brother William, the author of
“Zenobia,” in 1816; William Hickling Prescott, in 1814; J. G. Palfrey,
in 1815; in 1817, George Bancroft and Caleb Cushing graduated, and
Ralph Waldo Emerson entered the college. Boston also drew resources
from other quarters, and perhaps showed no stronger proof of its vigor
than when, in 1816, it attracted Daniel Webster from New Hampshire to
identify himself with the intellect and interests of Massachusetts.
Even by reaction the Unitarians stimulated Boston,—as when, a few
years afterward, Lyman Beecher accepted the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span> charge of a Boston church
in order to resist their encroachments.</p>

<p>The “Anthology,” which marked the birth of the new literary school,
came in a few years to a natural end, but was revived in 1815 under
the name of the “North American Review,” by the exertions of William
Tudor. The life of the new Review belonged to a later period, and was
shaped by other influences than those that surrounded the “Anthology.”
With the beginning of the next epoch, the provincial stage of the
Boston school was closed. More and more its influence tended to become
national, and even to affect other countries. Perhaps by a natural
consequence rather than by coincidence, the close of the old period
was marked by the appearance of a short original poem in the “North
American Review” for September, 1817:—</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">

      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i10">“... The hills,</div>
        <div>Rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun; the vales</div>
        <div>Stretching in pensive quietness between;</div>
        <div>The venerable woods; the floods that move</div>
        <div>In majesty, and the complaining brooks</div>
        <div>That wind among the meads and make them green,—</div>

        <div>And make their bed with thee.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>The appearance of “Thanatopsis” and “Lines to a Waterfowl” in the early
numbers of the “North American Review,” while leaving no doubt that
a new national literature was close at hand, proved also that it was
not to be the product of a single source; for Bryant, though greatly
tempted to join the Emersons, Channing, Dana, Allston, and Tudor in
Boston, turned finally to New York, where influences of a different
kind surrounded him. The Unitarian school could not but take a sober
cast, and even its humor was sure to be tinged with sadness, sarcasm,
or irony, or some serious purpose or passion; but New York contained no
atmosphere in which such a society could thrive. Busy with the charge
of practical work,—the development of industries continually exceeding
their power of control,—the people of New York wanted amusement, and
shunned what in Boston was considered as intellectual. Their tastes
were gratified by the appearance of a writer whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span> first book created
a school of literature as distinctly marked as the Unitarian school
of Boston, and more decidedly original. “The History of New York, by
Diedrich Knickerbocker,” appeared in 1809, and stood alone. Other books
of the time seemed to recognize some literary parentage. Channing
and Buckminster were links in a chain of theologians and preachers.
“Thanatopsis” evidently drew inspiration from Wordsworth. Diedrich
Knickerbocker owed nothing to any living original.</p>

<p>The “History of New York” was worth more than passing notice. In the
development of a national character, as well as of the literature that
reflected it, humor was a trait of the utmost interest; and Washington
Irving was immediately recognized as a humorist whose name, if he
fulfilled the promise of his first attempt, would have a chance of
passing into the society of Rabelais, Cervantes, Butler, and Sterne.
Few literary tasks were more difficult than to burlesque without
vulgarizing, and to satirize without malignity; yet Irving in his first
effort succeeded in doing both. The old families, and serious students
of colonial history, never quite forgave Irving for throwing an
atmosphere of ridicule over the subject of their interest; but Diedrich
Knickerbocker’s History was so much more entertaining than ordinary
histories, that even historians could be excused for regretting that it
should not be true.</p>

<p>Yet the book reflected the political passions which marked the period
of the Embargo. Besides the burlesque,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span> the “History” contained satire;
and perhaps its most marked trait was the good-nature which, at a time
when bitterness was universal in politics, saved Irving’s political
satire from malignity. Irving meant that no one should mistake the
character of the universal genius, Governor Wilhelmus Kieft, surnamed
the Testy, who as a youth had made many curious investigations into
the nature and operations of windmills, and who came well-nigh being
smothered in a slough of unintelligible learning,—“a fearful peril,
from the effects of which he never perfectly recovered.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“No sooner had this bustling little man been blown by a whiff
of fortune into the seat of government, than he called together
his council and delivered a very animated speech on the affairs
of the government; ... and here he soon worked himself into a
fearful rage against the Yankees, whom he compared to the Gauls
who desolated Rome, and to the Goths and Vandals who overran
the fairest plains of Europe.... Having thus artfully wrought
up his tale of terror to a climax, he assumed a self-satisfied
look, and declared with a nod of knowing import that he had
taken measures to put a final stop to these encroachments,—that
he had been obliged to have recourse to a dreadful engine of
warfare, lately invented, awful in its effects but authorized
by direful necessity; in a word, he was resolved to conquer the
Yankees—by Proclamation.”</p>
</div>

<p>Washington Irving’s political relations were those commonly known as
Burrite, through his brother Peter, who edited in Burr’s interest the
“Morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span> Chronicle.” Antipathy to Jefferson was a natural result, and
Irving’s satire on the President was the more interesting because the
subject offered temptations for ill-tempered sarcasm such as spoiled
Federalist humor. The Knickerbocker sketch of Jefferson was worth
comparing with Federalist modes of expressing the same ideas:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The great defect of Wilhelmus Kieft’s policy was that though no
man could be more ready to stand forth in an hour of emergency,
yet he was so intent upon guarding the national pocket that
he suffered the enemy to break its head.... All this was a
remote consequence of his education at the Hague; where, having
acquired a smattering of knowledge, he was ever a great conner
of indexes, continually dipping into books without ever studying
to the bottom of any subject, so that he had the scum of all
kinds of authors fermenting in his pericranium. In some of
these titlepage researches he unluckily stumbled over a grand
political <i>cabalistic word</i>, which with his customary
facility he immediately incorporated into his great scheme of
government, to the irretrievable injury and delusion of the
honest province of Nieuw Nederlands, and the eternal misleading
of all experimental rulers.”</p>
</div>

<p>Little was wanting to make such a sketch bitter; but Irving seemed to
have the power of deadening venom by a mere trick of hand. Readers of
the “History,” after a few years had passed, rarely remembered the
satire, or supposed that the story contained it. The humor and the
style remained to characterize a school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span></p>

<p>The originality of the Knickerbocker humor was the more remarkable
because it was allowed to stand alone. Irving published nothing else of
consequence until 1819, and then, abandoning his early style, inclined
to imitate Addison and Steele, although his work was hardly the less
original. Irving preceded Walter Scott, whose “Waverley” appeared in
1814, and “Guy Mannering” in 1815; and if either author could be said
to influence the other, the influence of Diedrich Knickerbocker on
Scott was more evident than that of “Waverley” on Irving.</p>

<p>In the face of the spontaneous burst of genius which at that moment
gave to English literature and art a character distinct even in its
own experience, Americans might have been excused for making no figure
at all. Other periods produced one poet at a time, and measured
originality by single poems; or satisfied their ambition by prose or
painting of occasional merit. The nineteenth century began in England
with genius as plenty as it was usually rare. To Beattie, Cowper,
and Burns, succeeded Wordsworth, Coleridge, Scott, Byron, Crabbe,
Campbell, Charles Lamb, Moore, Shelley, and Keats. The splendor of
this combination threw American and even French talent into the
shade, and defied hope of rivalry; but the American mind, as far as
it went, showed both freshness and originality. The divergence of
American from English standards seemed insignificant to critics who
required, as they commonly did, a national<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span> literature founded on some
new conception,—such as the Shawanee or Aztecs could be supposed
to suggest; but to those who expected only a slow variation from
European types, the difference was well marked. Channing and Irving
were American in literature, as Calhoun and Webster were American
in politics. They were the product of influences as peculiar to the
country as those which produced Fulton and his steamboat.</p>

<p>While Bryant published “Thanatopsis” and Irving made his studies for
the “Sketch-Book,” another American of genius perhaps superior to
theirs—Washington Allston—was painting in London, before returning
to pass the remainder of his life in the neighborhood of Boston and
Harvard College. Between thirty and forty years of age, Allston was
then in the prime of his powers; and even in a circle of artists which
included Turner, Wilkie, Mulready, Constable, Callcott, Crome, Cotman,
and a swarm of others equally famous, Allston was distinguished. Other
Americans took rank in the same society. Leslie and Stuart Newton were
adopted into it, and Copley died only in 1815, while Trumbull painted
in London till 1816; but remarkable though they were for the quality of
their art, they belonged to a British school, and could be claimed as
American only by blood. Allston stood in a relation somewhat different.
In part, his apparent Americanism was due to his later return, and to
his identification with American society; but the return itself was
probably caused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span> by a peculiar bent of character. His mind was not
wholly English.</p>

<p>Allston’s art and his originality were not such as might have been
expected from an American, or such as Americans were likely to admire;
and the same might be said of Leslie and Stuart Newton. Perhaps the
strongest instance of all was Edward Malbone, whose grace of execution
was not more remarkable than his talent for elevating the subject of
his exquisite work. So far from sharing the imagination of Shawanee
Indians or even of Democrats, these men instinctively reverted to the
most refined and elevated schools of art. Not only did Allston show
from the beginning of his career a passion for the nobler standards of
his profession, but also for technical quality,—a taste less usual.
Washington Irving met him in Rome in 1805, when both were unknown; and
they became warm friends.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I do not think I have ever been more captivated on a first
acquaintance,” wrote Irving long afterward. “He was of a light
and graceful form, with large blue eyes and black silken
hair. Everything about him bespoke the man of intellect and
refinement.... He was exquisitely sensitive to the graceful
and the beautiful, and took great delight in paintings which
excelled in color; yet he was strongly moved and aroused by
objects of grandeur. I well recollect the admiration with which
he contemplated the sublime statue of Moses, by Michael Angelo.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span></p>

<p>The same tastes characterized his life, and gave to his work a
distinction that might be Italian, but was certainly not English or
usual.</p>

<p>“It was Allston,” said Leslie, “who first awakened what little
sensibility I may possess to the beauties of color. For long time I
took the merit of the Venetians on trust, and if left to myself should
have preferred works which I now feel to be comparatively worthless.
I remember when the picture of ‘The Ages’ by Titian was first pointed
out to me by Allston as an exquisite work, I thought he was laughing
at me.” Leslie, if not a great colorist, was seldom incorrect; Stuart
Newton had a fine eye for color, and Malbone was emphatically a
colorist; but Allston’s sensibility to color was rare among artists,
and the refinement of his mind was as unusual as the delicacy of his
eye.</p>

<p>Allston was also singular in the liberality of his sympathies. “I am
by nature, as it respects the arts, a wide liker,” he said. In Rome he
became acquainted with Coleridge; and the remark of Coleridge which
seemed to make most impression on him in their walks “under the pines
of the Villa Borghese” was evidently agreeable because it expressed
his own feelings. “It was there he taught me this golden rule: never
to judge of any work of art by its defects.” His admiration for the
classics did not prevent him from admiring his contemporaries; his
journey through Switzerland not only showed him a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span> new world of Nature,
but also “the truth of Turner’s Swiss scenes,—the poetic truth,—which
none before or since have given.” For a young American art-student in
1804, such sympathies were remarkable; not so much because they were
correct, as because they were neither American nor English. Neither in
America nor in Europe at that day could art-schools give to every young
man, at the age of twenty-five, eyes to see the color of Titian, or
imagination to feel the “poetic truth” of Turner.</p>

<p>Other painters, besides those whose names have been mentioned, were
American or worked in America, as other writers besides Bryant and
Irving, and other preachers besides Buckminster and Channing, were
active in their professions; but for national comparisons, types
alone serve. In the course of sixteen years certain Americans became
distinguished. Among these, suitable for types, were Calhoun and Clay
in Congress, Pinkney and Webster at the bar, Buckminster and Channing
in the pulpit, Bryant and Irving in literature, Allston and Malbone in
painting. These men varied greatly in character and qualities. Some
possessed strength, and some showed more delicacy than vigor; some were
humorists, and some were incapable of a thought that was not serious;
but all were marked by a keen sense of form and style. So little was
this quality expected, that the world inclined to regard them as
un-American because of their refinement. Frenchmen and Italians, and
even Englishmen who knew nothing of America<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span> but its wildness, were
disappointed that American oratory should be only a variation from
Fox and Burke; that American literature should reproduce Steele and
Wordsworth; and that American art should, at its first bound, go back
to the ideals of Raphael and Titian. The incongruity was evident. The
Americans themselves called persistently for a statesmanship, religion,
literature, and art which should be American; and they made a number
of experiments to produce what they thought their ideals. In substance
they continued to approve nothing which was not marked by style as
its chief merit. The oratory of Webster and Calhoun, and even of John
Randolph, bore the same general and common character of style. The
poetry of Bryant, the humor of Irving, the sermons of Channing, and
the painting of Allston were the objects of permanent approval to the
national mind. Style remained its admiration, even when every newspaper
protested against the imitation of outworn forms. Dennie and Jefferson,
agreeing in nothing else, agreed in this; the South Carolinian Allston
saw color as naturally as the New Englander Bryant heard rhythm; and a
people which seemed devoid of sense or standards of beauty, showed more
ambition than older societies to acquire both.</p>

<p>Nothing seemed more certain than that the Americans were not artistic,
that they had as a people little instinct of beauty; but their
intelligence in its higher as in its lower forms was both quick and
refined.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span> Such literature and art as they produced, showed qualities
akin to those which produced the swift-sailing schooner, the triumph of
naval architecture. If the artistic instinct weakened, the quickness of
intelligence increased.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Until</span> 1815 nothing in the future of the American Union was
regarded as settled. As late as January, 1815, division into several
nationalities was still thought to be possible. Such a destiny,
repeating the usual experience of history, was not necessarily more
unfortunate than the career of a single nationality wholly American;
for if the effects of divided nationality were certain to be unhappy,
those of a single society with equal certainty defied experience or
sound speculation. One uniform and harmonious system appealed to
the imagination as a triumph of human progress, offering prospects
of peace and ease, contentment and philanthropy, such as the world
had not seen; but it invited dangers, formidable because unusual or
altogether unknown. The corruption of such a system might prove to be
proportionate with its dimensions, and uniformity might lead to evils
as serious as were commonly ascribed to diversity.</p>

<p>The laws of human progress were matter not for dogmatic faith, but for
study; and although society instinctively regarded small States, with
their clashing interests and incessant wars, as the chief obstacle
to improvement, such progress as the world knew had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span> been coupled
with those drawbacks. The few examples offered by history of great
political societies, relieved from external competition or rivalry,
were not commonly thought encouraging. War had been the severest test
of political and social character, laying bare whatever was feeble, and
calling out whatever was strong; and the effect of removing such a test
was an untried problem.</p>

<p>In 1815 for the first time Americans ceased to doubt the path they were
to follow. Not only was the unity of their nation established, but
its probable divergence from older societies was also well defined.
Already in 1817 the difference between Europe and America was decided.
In politics the distinction was more evident than in social, religious,
literary, or scientific directions; and the result was singular.
For a time the aggressions of England and France forced the United
States into a path that seemed to lead toward European methods of
government; but the popular resistance, or inertia, was so great that
the most popular party leaders failed to overcome it, and no sooner did
foreign dangers disappear than the system began to revert to American
practices; the national government tried to lay aside its assumed
powers. When Madison vetoed the bill for internal improvements he could
have had no other motive than that of restoring to the government, as
far as possible, its original American character.</p>

<p>The result was not easy to understand in theory or to make efficient
in practice; but while the drift of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span> public opinion, and still
more of practical necessity, drew the government slowly toward the
European standard of true political sovereignty, nothing showed that
the compromise, which must probably serve the public purpose, was to
be European in form or feeling. As far as politics supplied a test,
the national character had already diverged from any foreign type.
Opinions might differ whether the political movement was progressive or
retrograde, but in any case the American, in his political character,
was a new variety of man.</p>

<p>The social movement was also decided. The war gave a severe shock
to the Anglican sympathies of society, and peace seemed to widen
the breach between European and American tastes. Interest in Europe
languished after Napoleon’s overthrow. France ceased to affect
American opinion. England became an object of less alarm. Peace
produced in the United States a social and economical revolution
which greatly curtailed the influence of New England, and with it the
social authority of Great Britain. The invention of the steamboat
counterbalanced ocean commerce. The South and West gave to society a
character more aggressively American than had been known before. That
Europe, within certain limits, might tend toward American ideas was
possible, but that America should under any circumstances follow the
experiences of European development might thenceforward be reckoned as
improbable. American character was formed, if not fixed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span></p>

<p>The scientific interest of American history centred in national
character, and in the workings of a society destined to become vast,
in which individuals were important chiefly as types. Although this
kind of interest was different from that of European history, it was
at least as important to the world. Should history ever become a true
science, it must expect to establish its laws, not from the complicated
story of rival European nationalities, but from the economical
evolution of a great democracy. North America was the most favorable
field on the globe for the spread of a society so large, uniform,
and isolated as to answer the purposes of science. There a single
homogeneous society could easily attain proportions of three or four
hundred million persons, under conditions of undisturbed growth.</p>

<p>In Europe or Asia, except perhaps in China, undisturbed social
evolution had been unknown. Without disturbance, evolution seemed to
cease. Wherever disturbance occurred, permanence was impossible. Every
people in turn adapted itself to the law of necessity. Such a system as
that of the United States could hardly have existed for half a century
in Europe except under the protection of another power. In the fierce
struggle characteristic of European society, systems were permanent in
nothing except in the general law, that, whatever other character they
might possess they must always be chiefly military.</p>

<p>The want of permanence was not the only or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span> most confusing obstacle
to the treatment of European history as a science. The intensity of
the struggle gave prominence to the individual, until the hero seemed
all, society nothing; and what was worse for science, the men were far
more interesting than the societies. In the dramatic view of history,
the hero deserved more to be studied than the community to which he
belonged; in truth, he was the society, which existed only to produce
him and to perish with him. Against such a view historians were among
the last to protest, and protested but faintly when they did so at all.
They felt as strongly as their audiences that the highest achievements
were alone worth remembering either in history or in art, and that a
reiteration of commonplaces was commonplace. With all the advantages
of European movement and color, few historians succeeded in enlivening
or dignifying the lack of motive, intelligence, and morality, the
helplessness characteristic of many long periods in the face of
crushing problems, and the futility of human efforts to escape from
difficulties religious, political, and social. In a period extending
over four or five thousand years, more or less capable of historical
treatment, historians were content to illustrate here and there the
most dramatic moments of the most striking communities. The hero was
their favorite. War was the chief field of heroic action, and even the
history of England was chiefly the story of war.</p>

<p>The history of the United States promised to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span> free from such
disturbances. War counted for little, the hero for less; on the
people alone the eye could permanently rest. The steady growth of
a vast population without the social distinctions that confused
other histories,—without kings, nobles, or armies; without church,
traditions, and prejudices,—seemed a subject for the man of science
rather than for dramatists or poets. To scientific treatment only one
great obstacle existed. Americans, like Europeans, were not disposed
to make of their history a mechanical evolution. They felt that they
even more than other nations needed the heroic element, because they
breathed an atmosphere of peace and industry where heroism could seldom
be displayed; and in unconscious protest against their own social
conditions they adorned with imaginary qualities scores of supposed
leaders, whose only merit was their faculty of reflecting a popular
trait. Instinctively they clung to ancient history as though conscious
that of all misfortunes that could befall the national character,
the greatest would be the loss of the established ideals which alone
ennobled human weakness. Without heroes, the national character of the
United States had few charms of imagination even to Americans.</p>

<p>Historians and readers maintained Old-World standards. No historian
cared to hasten the coming of an epoch when man should study his own
history in the same spirit and by the same methods with which he
studied the formation of a crystal. Yet history had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span> its scientific as
well as its human side, and in American history the scientific interest
was greater than the human. Elsewhere the student could study under
better conditions the evolution of the individual, but nowhere could he
study so well the evolution of a race. The interest of such a subject
exceeded that of any other branch of science, for it brought mankind
within sight of its own end.</p>

<p>Travellers in Switzerland who stepped across the Rhine where it flowed
from its glacier could follow its course among mediæval towns and
feudal ruins, until it became a highway for modern industry, and at
last arrived at a permanent equilibrium in the ocean. American history
followed the same course. With prehistoric glaciers and mediæval
feudalism the story had little to do; but from the moment it came
within sight of the ocean it acquired interest almost painful. A child
could find his way in a river-valley, and a hoy could float on the
waters of Holland; but science alone could sound the depths of the
ocean, measure its currents, foretell its storms, or fix its relations
to the system of Nature. In a democratic ocean science could see
something ultimate. Man could go no further. The atom might move, but
the general equilibrium could not change.</p>

<p>Whether the scientific or the heroic view were taken, in either case
the starting-point was the same, and the chief object of interest was
to define national character. Whether the figures of history were
treated as heroes or as types, they must be taken to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span> represent the
people. American types were especially worth study if they were to
represent the greatest democratic evolution the world could know.
Readers might judge for themselves what share the individual possessed
in creating or shaping the nation; but whether it was small or great,
the nation could be understood only by studying the individual. For
that reason, in the story of Jefferson and Madison individuals retained
their old interest as types of character, if not as sources of power.</p>

<p>In the American character antipathy to war ranked first among political
traits. The majority of Americans regarded war in a peculiar light,
the consequence of comparative security. No European nation could have
conducted a war, as the people of America conducted the War of 1812.
The possibility of doing so without destruction explained the existence
of the national trait, and assured its continuance. In politics, the
divergence of America from Europe perpetuated itself in the popular
instinct for peaceable methods. The Union took shape originally on the
general lines that divided the civil from the military elements of the
British constitution. The party of Jefferson and Gallatin was founded
on dislike of every function of government necessary in a military
system. Although Jefferson carried his pacific theories to an extreme,
and brought about a military reaction, the reactionary movement was
neither universal, violent, nor lasting; and society showed no sign
of changing its convictions. With greater strength<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span> the country might
acquire greater familiarity with warlike methods, but in the same
degree was less likely to suffer any general change of habits. Nothing
but prolonged intestine contests could convert the population of an
entire continent into a race of warriors.</p>

<p>A people whose chief trait was antipathy to war, and to any system
organized with military energy, could scarcely develop great results in
national administration; yet the Americans prided themselves chiefly on
their political capacity. Even the war did not undeceive them, although
the incapacity brought into evidence by the war was undisputed, and
was most remarkable among the communities which believed themselves to
be most gifted with political sagacity. Virginia and Massachusetts by
turns admitted failure in dealing with issues so simple that the newest
societies, like Tennessee and Ohio, understood them by instinct. That
incapacity in national politics should appear as a leading trait in
American character was unexpected by Americans, but might naturally
result from their conditions. The better test of American character was
not political but social, and was to be found not in the government but
in the people.</p>

<p>The sixteen years of Jefferson’s and Madison’s rule furnished
international tests of popular intelligence upon which Americans
could depend. The ocean was the only open field for competition among
nations. Americans enjoyed there no natural or artificial advantages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
over Englishmen, Frenchmen, or Spaniards; indeed, all these countries
possessed navies, resources, and experience greater than were to be
found in the United States. Yet the Americans developed, in the course
of twenty years, a surprising degree of skill in naval affairs. The
evidence of their success was to be found nowhere so complete as in
the avowals of Englishmen who knew best the history of naval progress.
The American invention of the fast-sailing schooner or clipper was the
more remarkable because, of all American inventions, this alone sprang
from direct competition with Europe. During ten centuries of struggle
the nations of Europe had labored to obtain superiority over each other
in ship-construction, yet Americans instantly made improvements which
gave them superiority, and which Europeans were unable immediately to
imitate even after seeing them. Not only were American vessels better
in model, faster in sailing, easier and quicker in handling, and more
economical in working than the European, but they were also better
equipped. The English complained as a grievance that the Americans
adopted new and unwarranted devices in naval warfare; that their
vessels were heavier and better constructed, and their missiles of
unusual shape and improper use. The Americans resorted to expedients
that had not been tried before, and excited a mixture of irritation
and respect in the English service, until Yankee smartness became a
national misdemeanor.</p>

<p>The English admitted themselves to be slow to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span> change their habits,
but the French were both quick and scientific; yet Americans did on
the ocean what the French, under stronger inducements, failed to do.
The French privateer preyed upon British commerce for twenty years
without seriously injuring it; but no sooner did the American privateer
sail from French ports, than the rates of insurance doubled in London,
and an outcry for protection arose among English shippers which the
Admiralty could not calm. The British newspapers were filled with
assertions that the American cruiser was the superior of any vessel of
its class, and threatened to overthrow England’s supremacy on the ocean.</p>

<p>Another test of relative intelligence was furnished by the battles
at sea. Instantly after the loss of the “Guerriere” the English
discovered and complained that American gunnery was superior to their
own. They explained their inferiority by the length of time that had
elapsed since their navy had found on the ocean an enemy to fight.
Every vestige of hostile fleets had been swept away, until, after
the battle of Trafalgar, British frigates ceased practice with their
guns. Doubtless the British navy had become somewhat careless in the
absence of a dangerous enemy, but Englishmen were themselves aware
that some other cause must have affected their losses. Nothing showed
that Nelson’s line-of-battle ships, frigates, or sloops were as a
rule better fought than the “Macedonian” and “Java,” the “Avon” and
“Reindeer.” Sir Howard Douglas, the chief authority<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span> on the subject,
attempted in vain to explain British reverses by the deterioration of
British gunnery. His analysis showed only that American gunnery was
extraordinarily good. Of all vessels, the sloop-of-war,—on account
of its smallness, its quick motion, and its more accurate armament
of thirty-two-pound carronades,—offered the best test of relative
gunnery, and Sir Howard Douglas in commenting upon the destruction of
the “Peacock” and “Avon” could only say,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In these two actions it is clear that the fire of the British
vessels was thrown too high, and that the ordnance of their
opponents were expressly and carefully aimed at and took effect
chiefly in the hull.”</p>
</div>

<p>The battle of the “Hornet” and “Penguin” as well as those of the
“Reindeer” and “Avon,” showed that the excellence of American gunnery
continued till the close of the war. Whether at point-blank range or at
long-distance practice, the Americans used guns as they had never been
used at sea before.</p>

<p>None of the reports of former British victories showed that the
British fire had been more destructive at any previous time than in
1812, and no report of any commander since the British navy existed
showed so much damage inflicted on an opponent in so short a time as
was proved to have been inflicted on themselves by the reports of
British commanders in the American war. The strongest proof of American
superiority was given by the best British officers, like Broke, who
strained every nerve to maintain an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span> equality with American gunnery.
So instantaneous and energetic was the effort that, according to the
British historian of the war, “a British forty-six-gun frigate of 1813
was half as effective again as a British forty-six-gun frigate of
1812;” and, as he justly said, “the slaughtered crews and the shattered
hulks” of the captured British ships proved that no want of their old
fighting qualities accounted for their repeated and almost habitual
mortifications.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>Unwilling as the English were to admit the superior skill of Americans
on the ocean, they did not hesitate to admit it, in certain respects,
on land. The American rifle in American hands was affirmed to have no
equal in the world. This admission could scarcely be withheld after the
lists of killed and wounded which followed almost every battle; but the
admission served to check a wider inquiry. In truth, the rifle played
but a small part in the war. Winchester’s men at the river Raisin may
have owed their over-confidence, as the British Forty-first owed its
losses, to that weapon, and at New Orleans five or six hundred of
Coffee’s men, who were out of range, were armed with the rifle; but the
surprising losses of the British were commonly due to artillery and
musketry fire. At New Orleans the artillery was chiefly engaged. The
artillery battle of January 1, according to British accounts, amply
proved the superiority of American gunnery on that occasion, which was
probably the fairest test during the war.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span> The battle of January 8 was
also chiefly an artillery battle; the main British column never arrived
within fair musket range; Pakenham was killed by a grape-shot, and the
main column of his troops halted more than one hundred yards from the
parapet.</p>

<p>The best test of British and American military qualities, both for
men and weapons, was Scott’s battle of Chippawa. Nothing intervened
to throw a doubt over the fairness of the trial. Two parallel lines
of regular soldiers, practically equal in numbers, armed with similar
weapons, moved in close order toward each other, across a wide open
plain, without cover or advantage of position, stopping at intervals
to load and fire, until one line broke and retired. At the same time
two three-gun batteries, the British being the heavier, maintained
a steady fire from positions opposite each other. According to the
reports, the two infantry lines in the centre never came nearer than
eighty yards. Major-General Riall reported that then, owing to severe
losses, his troops broke and could not be rallied. Comparison of the
official reports showed that the British lost in killed and wounded
four hundred and sixty-nine men; the Americans, two hundred and
ninety-six. Some doubts always affect the returns of wounded, because
the severity of the wound cannot be known; but dead men tell their
own tale. Riall reported one hundred and forty-eight killed; Scott
reported sixty-one. The severity of the losses showed that the battle
was sharply contested, and proved the personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span> bravery of both armies.
Marksmanship decided the result, and the returns proved that the
American fire was superior to that of the British in the proportion of
more than fifty per cent if estimated by the entire loss, and of two
hundred and forty-two to one hundred if estimated by the deaths alone.</p>

<p>The conclusion seemed incredible, but it was supported by the results
of the naval battles. The Americans showed superiority amounting in
some cases to twice the efficiency of their enemies in the use of
weapons. The best French critic of the naval war, Jurien de la Gravière
said: “An enormous superiority in the rapidity and precision of their
fire can alone explain the difference in the losses sustained by the
combatants.”<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> So far from denying this conclusion the British
press constantly alleged it, and the British officers complained of
it. The discovery caused great surprise, and in both British services
much attention was at once directed to improvement in artillery and
musketry. Nothing could exceed the frankness with which Englishmen
avowed their inferiority. According to Sir Francis Head, “gunnery was
in naval warfare in the extraordinary state of ignorance we have just
described, when our lean children, the American people, taught us, rod
in hand, our first lesson in the art.” The English textbook on Naval
Gunnery, written by Major-General Sir Howard Douglas immediately after
the peace, devoted more attention to the short American war<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span> than to
all the battles of Napoleon, and began by admitting that Great Britain
had “entered with too great confidence on war with a marine much
more expert than that of any of our European enemies.” The admission
appeared “objectionable” even to the author;<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> but he did not add,
what was equally true, that it applied as well to the land as to the
sea service.</p>

<p>No one questioned the bravery of the British forces, or the ease with
which they often routed larger bodies of militia; but the losses
they inflicted were rarely as great as those they suffered. Even at
Bladensburg, where they met little resistance, their loss was several
times greater than that of the Americans. At Plattsburg, where the
intelligence and quickness of Macdonough and his men alone won the
victory, his ships were in effect stationary batteries, and enjoyed
the same superiority in gunnery. “The ‘Saratoga,’” said his official
report, “had fifty-five round-shot in her hull; the ‘Confiance,’ one
hundred and five. The enemy’s shot passed principally just over our
heads, as there were not twenty whole hammocks in the nettings at the
close of the action.”</p>

<p>The greater skill of the Americans was not due to special training, for
the British service was better trained in gunnery, as in everything
else, than the motley armies and fleets that fought at New Orleans and
on the Lakes. Critics constantly said that every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span> American had learned
from his childhood the use of the rifle, but he certainly had not
learned to use cannon in shooting birds or hunting deer, and he know
less than the Englishman about the handling of artillery and muskets.
As if to add unnecessary evidence, the battle of Chrystler’s Farm
proved only too well that this American efficiency was not confined to
citizens of the United States.</p>

<p>Another significant result of the war was the sudden development
of scientific engineering in the United States. This branch of the
military service owed its efficiency and almost its existence to the
military school at West Point, established in 1802. The school was at
first much neglected by government. The number of graduates before the
year 1812 was very small; but at the outbreak of the war the corps of
engineers was already efficient. Its chief was Colonel Joseph Gardner
Swift, of Massachusetts, the first graduate of the academy: Colonel
Swift planned the defences of New York harbor. The lieutenant-colonel
in 1812 was Walker Keith Armistead, of Virginia,—the third graduate,
who planned the defences of Norfolk. Major William McRee, of North
Carolina, became chief engineer to General Brown, and constructed the
fortifications at Fort Erie, which cost the British General Gordon
Drummond the loss of half his army, besides the mortification of
defeat. Captain Eleazer Derby Wood, of New York, constructed Fort
Meigs, which enabled Harrison to defeat the attack of Proctor in May,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
1813. Captain Joseph Gilbert Totten, of New York, was chief engineer
to General Izard at Plattsburg, where he directed the fortifications
that stopped the advance of Prevost’s great army. None of the works
constructed by a graduate of West Point was captured by the enemy; and
had an engineer been employed at Washington by Armstrong and Winder,
the city would have been easily saved.</p>

<p>Perhaps without exaggeration the West Point Academy might be said to
have decided, next to the navy, the result of the war. The works at
New Orleans were simple in character, and as far as they were due to
engineering skill were directed by Major Latour, a Frenchman; but the
war was already ended when the battle of New Orleans was fought. During
the critical campaign of 1814, the West Point engineers doubled the
capacity of the little American army for resistance, and introduced a
new and scientific character into American life.</p>

<p>In the application of science the steamboat was the most striking
success; but Fulton’s invention, however useful, was neither the
most original nor the most ingenious of American efforts, nor did it
offer the best example of popular characteristics. Perhaps Fulton’s
torpedo and Stevens’s screw-propeller showed more originality than
was proved by the “Clermont.” The fast-sailing schooner with its
pivot-gun—an invention that grew out of the common stock of nautical
intelligence—best illustrated the character of the people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span></p>

<p>That the individual should rise to a higher order either of
intelligence or morality than had existed in former ages was not to be
expected, for the United States offered less field for the development
of individuality than had been offered by older and smaller societies.
The chief function of the American Union was to raise the average
standard of popular intelligence and well-being, and at the close of
the War of 1812 the superior average intelligence of Americans was so
far admitted that Yankee acuteness, or smartness, became a national
reproach; but much doubt remained whether the intelligence belonged
to a high order, or proved a high morality. From the earliest ages,
shrewdness was associated with unscrupulousness; and Americans were
freely charged with wanting honesty. The charge could neither be
proved nor disproved. American morality was such as suited a people so
endowed, and was high when compared with the morality of many older
societies; but, like American intelligence, it discouraged excess.
Probably the political morality shown by the government and by public
men during the first sixteen years of the century offered a fair gauge
of social morality. Like the character of the popular inventions,
the character of the morals corresponded to the wants of a growing
democratic society; but time alone could decide whether it would result
in a high or a low national ideal.</p>

<p>Finer analysis showed other signs of divergence from ordinary
standards. If Englishmen took pride<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span> in one trait more than in another,
it was in the steady uniformity of their progress. The innovating and
revolutionary quality of the French mind irritated them. America showed
an un-English rapidity in movement. In politics, the American people
between 1787 and 1817 accepted greater changes than had been known
in England since 1688. In religion, the Unitarian movement of Boston
and Harvard College would never have been possible in England, where
the defection of Oxford or Cambridge, and the best educated society
in the United Kingdom, would have shaken Church and State to their
foundations. In literature the American school was chiefly remarkable
for the rapidity with which it matured. The first book of Irving was a
successful burlesque of his own ancestral history; the first poem of
Bryant sang of the earth only as a universal tomb; the first preaching
of Channing assumed to overthrow the Trinity; and the first paintings
of Allston aspired to recover the ideal perfection of Raphael and
Titian. In all these directions the American mind showed tendencies
that surprised Englishmen more than they struck Americans. Allston
defended himself from the criticism of friends who made complaint of
his return to America. He found there, as he maintained, not only a
growing taste for art, but “a quicker appreciation” of artistic effort
than in any European land. If the highest intelligence of American
society were to move with such rapidity, the time could not be far
distant when it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span> pass into regions which England never liked to
contemplate.</p>

<p>Another intellectual trait, as has been already noticed, was the
disposition to relax severity. Between the theology of Jonathan
Edwards and that of William Ellery Channing was an enormous gap, not
only in doctrines but also in methods. Whatever might be thought of
the conclusions reached by Edwards and Hopkins, the force of their
reasoning commanded respect. Not often had a more strenuous effort than
theirs been made to ascertain God’s will, and to follow it without
regard to weaknesses of the flesh. The idea that the nature of God’s
attributes was to be preached only as subordinate to the improvement of
man, agreed little with the spirit of their religion. The Unitarian and
Universalist movements marked the beginning of an epoch when ethical
and humanitarian ideas took the place of metaphysics, and even New
England turned from contemplating the omnipotence of the Deity in order
to praise the perfections of his creatures.</p>

<p>The spread of great popular sects like the Universalists and
Campbellites, founded on assumptions such as no Orthodox theology could
tolerate, showed a growing tendency to relaxation of thought in that
direction. The struggle for existence was already mitigated, and the
first effect of the change was seen in the increasing cheerfulness of
religion. Only when men found their actual world almost a heaven, could
they lose overpowering anxiety about the world to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span> come. Life had taken
a softer aspect, and as a consequence God was no longer terrible. Even
the wicked became less mischievous in an atmosphere where virtue was
easier than vice. Punishments seemed mild in a society where every
offender could cast off his past, and create a new career. For the
first time in history, great bodies of men turned away from their old
religion, giving no better reason than that it required them to believe
in a cruel Deity, and rejected necessary conclusions of theology
because they were inconsistent with human self-esteem.</p>

<p>The same optimism marked the political movement. Society was weary of
strife, and settled gladly into a political system which left every
disputed point undetermined. The public seemed obstinate only in
believing that all was for the best, as far as the United States were
concerned, in the affairs of mankind. The contrast was great between
this temper of mind and that in which the Constitution had been framed;
but it was no greater than the contrast in the religious opinions
of the two periods, while the same reaction against severity marked
the new literature. The rapid accumulation of wealth and increase in
physical comfort told the same story from the standpoint of economy. On
every side society showed that ease was for a time to take the place
of severity, and enjoyment was to have its full share in the future
national existence.</p>

<p>The traits of intelligence, rapidity, and mildness seemed fixed in
the national character as early as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span> 1817, and were likely to become
more marked as time should pass. A vast amount of conservatism still
lingered among the people; but the future spirit of society could
hardly fail to be intelligent, rapid in movement, and mild in method.
Only in the distant future could serious change occur, and even then
no return to European characteristics seemed likely. The American
continent was happier in its conditions and easier in its resources
than the regions of Europe and Asia, where Nature revelled in diversity
and conflict. If at any time American character should change, it might
as probably become sluggish as revert to the violence and extravagances
of Old-World development. The inertia of several hundred million
people, all formed in a similar social mould, was as likely to stifle
energy as to stimulate evolution.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>With the establishment of these conclusions, a new episode in American
history began in 1815. New subjects demanded new treatment, no longer
dramatic but steadily tending to become scientific. The traits of
American character were fixed; the rate of physical and economical
growth was established; and history, certain that at a given distance
of time the Union would contain so many millions of people, with wealth
valued at so many millions of dollars, became thenceforward chiefly
concerned to know what kind of people these millions were to be. They
were intelligent, but what paths would their intelligence select? They
were quick, but what solution of insoluble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span> problems would quickness
hurry? They were scientific, and what control would their science
exercise over their destiny? They were mild, but what corruptions would
their relaxations bring? They were peaceful, but by what machinery were
their corruptions to be purged? What interests were to vivify a society
so vast and uniform? What ideals were to ennoble it? What object,
besides physical content, must a democratic continent aspire to attain?
For the treatment of such questions, history required another century
of experience.</p>
